            <description><![CDATA[<p>When we adopt the minimalism ideology, we use it primarily as a tool. A tool to rid the excess in life to make way for that which is important and for the things we value most. Minimalism not only inspires me to live more simply, it also influences my approach to design.</p>
<p>I wanted to create a resource that many minimalists would value—and not just the design conscious looking for a bit of inspiration, but even those looking to live a more meaningful life. I didn’t look to recreate something that already exists with a simpler approach. Instead, I realised that what I needed simply did not exist—an ever evolving list to all things minimal. I decided to create the ultimate bookmark for minimalism enthusiasts, including everything from books, bikes, clothing, furniture, to technology. All presented in a clear, well-structured, and unobtrusive categorised list of text links. Created in collaboration with web developer <a href="https://manuelmoreale.com" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Manu Moreale</a>, we launched <a href="https://mnmll.ist" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Mnmllist</a>.</p>
<p>It lists only 3 items per category, but each category can be expanded to display more links if we’ve got round to adding them.</p>
<p>Of course, there are many blogs and resources out there dedicated to minimalism, but nothing that is open to literally anything. The site is still in its infancy, but we’re having fun curating this over time, and we invite contributions if you can think of any categories or specific links you think we should add. We hope this little <a href="https://mnmll.ist" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Mnmllist</a> site will become a useful resource for you. If not today, then perhaps when it’s more mature.</p>]]></description>

            <title>Capsule Wardrobe</title>
            <link>https://carlbarenbrug.com/@/page/TaIzBrZaFWNywpNN</link>

            <pubDate>Sat, 07 Dec 2020 00:00:00 +0100</pubDate>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>A capsule wardrobe is simply a collection of essential items of clothing that don’t really go out of fashion, which can then be augmented with seasonal pieces. Although a capsule wardrobe could certainly be defined as minimal in its own right, my wardrobe goes a little beyond that and limits the colour palette to just a few, making it even simpler and stress-free everyday. You could say my wardrobe is utilitarian where simplicity and practicality take precedence over style.</p>
<p>My wardrobe is basically broken down like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>5 x Black Sweatshirts  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>2 x Dark Grey Sweatshirts  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>3 x Light Grey Sweatshirts</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>8 x Black T-shirts  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>2 x Light Grey T-shirts</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>2 x White T-shirts  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>4 x Black Long Sleeve T-shirts</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>2 x Black Jeans  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>1 x Dark Grey Jeans  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>3 x Black Sweatpants</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>1 x White Shirt</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>1 x Black Belt</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>1 x Black Baseball Cap</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>4 x Black Jackets (seasonal)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>3 x Sneakers</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>1 x Black Boots</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>1 x Black Formal Shoes</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>2 x Wristwatches</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>PLUS underwear, gym wear, and a single navy blue suit</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>That is literally it. Barely anything to some, maybe excessive to others, but it’s what works for me and I’m always intentional with what I buy. When a piece of clothing no longer interests me or is too worn, I’ll either donate it or recycle it. Put it this way, if you haven’t worn a particular piece of clothing for a year, all it’s doing is taking up unnecessary space in your wardrobe. Is it really that important to you to keep a hold of it? If the answer is no, you can give it to someone who would appreciate it. Also, if you do feel inspired to streamline your wardrobe, I guarantee it’ll feel liberating—which is why I try to do this a couple of times a year.</p>]]></description>

            <title>Monetising Minimalism</title>
            <link>https://carlbarenbrug.com/@/page/S6Dr05VmXNcL4lzs</link>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>To keep a site sustainable, it needs to be funded to some extent. Enough at least to tread water, but more heavily if the site (or project) is to evolve to any meaningful degree. If a project can be self-sustainable by means of its own monetisation, that is the ideal situation. If however, the site and its contents are entirely free to consume, financial support must come from an alternative source.</p>
<p>In many cases, this isn’t much of an issue, because often these projects are born out of enthusiasm for a particular subject, or just to fulfil a creative urge. In these cases, there really isn’t much pressure for these projects to evolve or even become sustainable. But what if a project you’re involved in organically grows into something greater than you had initially anticipated, and with that, your vision for it? What if you no longer see it as a side project, but rather something that you could and want to be spending more of your time on? What if such a project is related to Minimalism?</p>
<p>With one of my side projects—<a href="https://minimalism.life" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Minimalism Life</a>—I face a dilemma. A decision as to whether or not to monetise a fast growing site that is focused on living a minimalist lifestyle. Therein lies the fine line between meaningful growth and hypocrisy—encouraging a minimalist to buy things from you kind of goes against the ethos of living a minimal life. As the site and readership grows, so too does our own standards in quality of content and consistency—because the content needs to add some value to our readers, right? To do this, we need to work with contributors and importantly, pay them. Our current team doesn’t have the dedicated time or skills to consistently produce quality articles, for instance. So how do we hire the right people, reward our own time and effort, as well as staying true to the ethos of minimalism? As I said, it’s a fine line with very limited options.</p>
<p>Placed advertising is obviously out of the question. As is an online shop—that’s just more stuff. We’re not going to write and sell books, and we’re not going to take commissions through affiliate selling. We’re not motivational speakers either, so that’s also out of the question. So where does that leave us? Ultimately, it leaves us with two options: collaborations with brands who share our values, or subscription-based premium content. The former could work, but it’s not something that would be done on a regular basis—that’ll just serve to piss off our readers, therefore income would be very small. So a subscription plan would be the most viable option.</p>
<p>Understandably, content creation has overheads in one form or another, so if there’s an opportunity to produce valuable content with a small price tag to sustain that platform and its creators, isn’t that justifiable? Essentially, this “business model” focuses on the pursuit of sustainability, not the pursuit of money—although there’s no denying its importance.</p>
<p>If we delve deeper into that model, there’s plenty of other things to consider. Such as:</p>
<p>Who creates the premium content from Day 1 if it requires hiring a full/part-time writer?<br />
How do we fund that Day 1 content?<br />
How much do we charge for the subscription?<br />
Should there be a renewal fee or a one-off access fee?<br />
Do we self-host this premium content or use <a href="https://www.patreon.com" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Patreon</a>?</p>
<p>It’s a challenge.</p>
<p>If you have any friendly and constructive advice, please <a href="mailto:&#99;&#x6d;&#104;&#98;&#x61;&#114;&#101;&#x6e;&#98;&#114;&#117;&#x67;&#x40;&#x67;&#109;&#x61;&#x69;&#108;&#46;&#x63;&#x6f;&#109;">drop me an email</a>.</p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>I have been involved in running <a href="https://minimalissimo.com" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Minimalissimo</a> since 2012, when I took it over from two Dutch designers Maarten P Kappert and Stan Grootes—who did an incredible job to gain a substantial readership. Since then, I’ve looked to evolve the site from a blog into a more rounded magazine. This is not only reflected editorially, but also in terms of its scalability. The core of the site has not drastically changed since its inception and with the emergence of many other minimal blogs and magazines, I have found that Minimalissimo is in need of a new creative direction. Not necessarily from the print side of the brand, but rather its digital side.</p>
<p>We’re still running in a very niche market, but this market is becoming increasingly competitive with the global rise of the minimalism movement. Although Minimalissimo might be considered a big fish in a small pond, I am never one to rest on my laurels, so I am planning a creative change for the brand. We want to give our readers a stronger reason to return to our site, to continue to find inspiration through what we publish, and how that published content is presented and consumed.</p>
<p>We are going to look at structural, editorial, aesthetic, and monetary changes. A significant part of this will be a complete website redevelopment from back to front. The project is now underway, so I am excited to share more with you soon, but I just wanted to express that we don’t just plan on Minimalissimo surviving in a saturated market, we plan on seeing it thrive with a new direction. Risky or not, we’re moving forward in order to focus more on experience and less on the numbers.</p>
<p>If you’re a long-term reader of Minimalissimo and want to get involved in how we could improve the site, I’d love to hear from you.</p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>We always seem to be aware of time, or rather, we feel we must be aware of it. The time of year, the time of day, and even how our time is spent. And for good reason—it helps us organise our lives, plan ahead, and be more efficient. I was thinking though—in an age when almost all of us use smartphones on a daily basis, why do we wear wristwatches?</p>
<p>We certainly don’t need to wear them. It’s rarely going to be a challenge to discover the time of day if you don’t wear one, even if you don’t have a smartphone on your person. Although the wristwatch (digital and analogue) is traditionally and essentially a functional tool, I feel it is generally no longer primarily used as such today. Of course, there are exceptional watch designs that cater to a very specific use, but generally speaking, we wear watches as a conscious fashion choice.</p>
<p>Even if that is the case, there is absolutely nothing wrong with that. Not everything we possess has to be used in a traditional way. I personally own two wristwatches, one of which I designed for <a href="https://minimalissimo.com/hodina-x-minimalissimo/" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Minimalissimo</a>, the other is the all black <a href="https://minimalissimo.com/no-1-36-black-edition/" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">TID Watch</a>, and I wear each as a fashion accessory.</p>
<p>However, if we consider wearable tech such as the <a href="https://www.apple.com/uk/watch/" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Apple Watch</a>, users tend to have a different relationship with their wristwatch. Although the Apple Watch has a strong, sleek aesthetic, its multi-functionalism flips the wearability reason from fashion to usability. This then leads me to ask the question: Why do you need to wear a smartwatch if you have a smartphone?</p>
<p>That is a question I have asked myself, and it’s partly the reason why I don’t own a smartwatch. To me, it’s superfluous and excessive, regardless of how impressive the technology is in its own right, but it could also be a reflection of my lifestyle. We all lead different lives, so naturally we use devices and tools differently.</p>
<p>So I would like to know, do you even wear a wristwatch? If so, what do you wear and why do you wear it?</p>]]></description>

            <title>Stepping Back from Black Friday</title>
            <link>https://carlbarenbrug.com/@/page/4BXIKxJi2P3FR1dP</link>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>The psychological warfare that is Black Friday. It is a time when consumerism is manipulated so intensely that people lose control of themselves, as well as their wallets. This excessive sales day has even evolved into a Black Friday sales week, which doesn’t really make much sense.</p>
<p>Now, I’m not suggesting that you should refrain from buying anything on Black Friday/Week, but what I would suggest is that you shop mindfully. Have a plan. Think about what you would like, whether it be for yourself, your home, or loved ones. If you do that, then you’re likely being savvy with your money, but in most cases, people impulse buy. They simply can’t resist a good deal regardless of whether they actually value or need that item. 20% off? 50% off? Well, it’s 100% off is you don’t actually buy it.</p>
<p>You also have to consider the true cost of a sale. One way or another, someone or something has to pay for it. And this isn’t just about the financial aspect of it. The greatest concern, at least to me, is the horrendous environmental impact, but that’s a whole other discussion.</p>
<p>The point is, stepping back from Black Friday will not only keep your balance in the black, it will help you regain control. Maybe spend your money, your time, and your energy on something a little more meaningful. Let’s focus on impressing upon the world our values instead of our possessions. Particularly if those possessions were nothing more than impulse buys.</p>]]></description>

            <title>Five Principles for Minimal Design</title>
            <link>https://carlbarenbrug.com/@/page/sDnWF9dbkBxlaUdd</link>
            <guid isPermaLink="false">blog/minimal-design</guid>
            <pubDate>Sun, 01 Jan 2022 00:00:00 +0100</pubDate>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>Minimalism in design has been engrained within my thinking ever since I was introduced to the work of Dieter Rams. He revolutionised industrial design in the 1950s and 60s through his ideology of “less, but better”. This resulted in his highly influential and ever inspiring <a href="https://www.vitsoe.com/gb/about/good-design" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Ten Principles for Good Design</a>, which he exemplified throughout his career with Braun and Vitsœ.</p>
<p>Through running <a href="https://minimalissimo.com" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Minimalissimo</a>, I have been introduced to many projects that demonstrate quintessential minimalism, as well as projects that really push the boundaries of what may be considered minimal. I have also been introduced to projects that claim to be minimal, but quite frankly, are anything but. I can now say with a fair degree of certainty what constitutes minimal design and what doesn’t, which I hope is reflected well in my curation of <a href="https://minimalissimo.com" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Minimalissimo</a>.</p>
<p>As I work with digital design daily as well as tangible product design, I have decided to ask myself a question similar to what Rams asked himself in the 1970s: what is minimal design?</p>
<p>I have tried to answer this question as best I can through the following five principles:</p>
<hr/>
<ol class="order">
<li style="padding-bottom: 2rem">
<h2>Minimal design is a byproduct of simple design</h2>
Simplicity is at the core of anything that represents minimalism. A simple approach to design is the only way to find its purest form.</li>
<li style="padding-bottom: 2rem">
<h2>Minimal design is understated</h2>
It is quiet, restrained, and modest yet expresses elegance and refinement through detail.</li>
<li style="padding-bottom: 2rem">
<h2>Minimal design exposes its essence to communicate its value</h2>
For a design to be appreciated, it must focus on the essential aspects. It must be devoid of unnecessary features to make it as clear and understandable as possible.</li>
<li style="padding-bottom: 2rem">
<h2>Minimal design is geometric</h2>
Its composition reflects pure and well-structured forms to emphasise the precision and intentionality of its development.</li>
<li>
<h2>Minimal design is a balance of form and function</h2>
By means of a well-executed build, it demonstrates the importance of aesthetics without compromising its core functionality and usefulness.</li>
</ol>
<hr/>
<p>These principles are, first and foremost, for my own reference. However, I think product designers who choose to adopt a minimalist approach to their work could also benefit from these principles. I feel that if we can adhere to these ideals in a collective sense, in conjunction with the fundamental ten created by Rams, we can produce even better design.</p>
<p><em>Note: I would also recommend reading Maarten P. Kappert's take on minimal design on <a href="http://understandingminimalism.com" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">understandingminimalism.com</a></em></p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>It has never been simpler to create a personal website than it is today. There are dozens, if not hundreds of companies that provide you with all the tools you need to create your own personalised platform of unfiltered self-expression. If you have the skills and knowledge to design and build one yourself, that’s even better, but today, (almost) anyone can create a site for themselves. Even setting up hosting and buying a domain name is easier than it has ever been.</p>
<p>Whether you’re building a personalised business or simply blogging, digital self-expression is not only important, it’s a fundamental freedom we are all afforded, and one we should embrace.</p>
<p>Although we are starting to see a new wave of blogging, many people use Twitter as a means to express themselves. I still use Twitter, so I can see some value in this platform, particularly to make personal and professional connections through common interests, or to simply share something I like. However, Twitter is also a tool that encourages negative, impulsive, and ill-considered behaviour. It doesn’t really keep our minds healthy—much like all social media—in the sense that we are constantly looking to see who has responded or engaged with what we have published. We’re in a constant feedback loop fuelled by ego, whether we like to admit that or not. It’s something you will rarely experience offline. Beyond these quite apparent issues, when we try to express a thought that requires more than 280 characters our ideas become diluted, misunderstood, and misrepresented. It’s fragmented writing within a fragmented community.</p>
<p>In today’s digital and political landscape, having a space to create and write what you like and how you like is valuable, if even in principle. You make the rules. You needn’t care whether people like, retweet, upvote, applaud, or comment on your words. You can write mindfully—with meaning, substance, and creative freedom.</p>

            <title>12 Things to Live Without</title>
            <link>https://carlbarenbrug.com/@/page/Sfys8l1xhrWcVCTL</link>
            <guid isPermaLink="false">blog/things-to-live-without</guid>
            <pubDate>Sat, 07 Dec 2020 00:00:00 +0100</pubDate>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>In 2018 I undertook a social experiment to see if I was self-disciplined and self-aware enough to live without 12 things. These 12 things would last just one month at a time between January–December, with the intention of identifying whether or not doing without these things would make a difference in my life. The premise was simple. The execution was not. You see, this is also lowering life’s requirements. Establishing what I feel I need and what is simply a "nice-to-have" option. The fewer requirements we have, the less of a burden these requirements become.</p>
<p>I wanted to introduce different ways of testing myself, tackling habits and routine. I went for the following:</p>
<ol class="order-less">
<li>January: Alcohol</li>
<li>February: Coffee</li>
<li>March: Personal Social Media</li>
<li>April: Meat</li>
<li>May: Lists</li>
<li>June: Free Weights for Calisthenics</li>
<li>July: Added Sugar</li>
<li>August: News (TV &amp; Internet)</li>
<li>September: Phone in the Evening (19:00-06:00)</li>
<li>October: Shaving</li>
<li>November: Personal/Home Purchases</li>
<li>December: Contact Lenses for Glasses</li>
</ol>
<h2>1. Alcohol</h2>
<p>I’m not a big drinker, so this was a rather simple start to the year. Typically, I would only drink once every couple of weeks at most, so I got through the month without issue. I feel I could easily live without alcohol permanently, but I won’t. I love a Negroni.</p>
<h2>2. Coffee</h2>
<p>Let the games begin! I also love coffee. The smell, the taste, the effects. This wasn’t going to be easy, but I wanted to determine whether I was addicted to coffee and if giving it up and substituting it with water and green tea would make much difference. I missed it, but I also realised I could absolutely live without it. The realisation was that coffee is a pleasure for me. Nothing more, nothing less.</p>
<h2>3. Personal Social Media</h2>
<p>I have a bit of a love/hate relationship with social media. Like most people, I use it to stay updated on things that aren’t really that important to my life, and I also use it as a creative outlet—particularly Instagram. Although I still photographed a lot of things and felt the urge to express certain things on Twitter, I fought those urges to publish and saw through the month successfully. This was actually a breath of fresh air. We take for granted just how toxic social media can be, even though we, for the most part, have relative control over what we consume. This is one experiment I would recommend to anyone.</p>
<h2>4. Meat</h2>
<p>I have always been a meat-eater and always thought that becoming a vegetarian—admirable though it is—would result in a pretty tasteless and unsatisfying diet. I was right. Although I got through the month eating lots of beans, pasta, pizza, cheese, and vegetables, it is not something I want to do on a permanent basis—at least not yet.</p>
<h2>5. Lists</h2>
<p>My first failure of the year. I write a to-do list every single day. It helps me to be more organised and focused. I also like scoring things off at the end of each day and quickly reflecting on how productive that day was. It’s a routine I wanted to break to see whether I could maintain my focus and to-dos without reviewing a list several times a day. This test came at a very unfortunate time though—I was right in the middle of producing <a href="https://minimalissimo.com" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Minimalissimo</a>’s third printed magazine. As you can imagine, keeping on top of a to-do list at that time wasn’t easy, so I said to myself that this social experiment wasn’t worth compromising my work with the mag. I was list-free for about five days.</p>
<h2>6. Free Weights for Calisthenics</h2>
<p>I workout every single day without fail, but with varying degrees of intensity throughout the week. Five of those days I am at the gym where the majority of training is through the use of free weights. Again, I wanted to change up this routine quite drastically, but at the same time maintain strength and muscle mass. My mistake for this month was that I had not researched enough calisthenic exercises before it started. Although I attempted various push/pull bodyweight routines, I wasn’t really enjoying it and my motivation to workout also softened, so about a week into the month, I reverted to incorporating free weights back into my workouts. My takeaway from this month however, is that I always add in at least one calisthenic exercise per training session.</p>
<h2>7. Added Sugar</h2>
<p>We should all look to reduce our sugar intake for our health. This was a month I wanted to be more mindful of the sugar contents I was consuming. I would look to avoid any foods that had ‘added sugar’ labelled on them. Sadly, I did give in to my cravings and I ended up lasting just over week of no added sugar. Still, I don’t do this often, and to this day I make a conscious effort not to buy too many sugary foods/drinks.</p>
<h2>8. News (TV &amp; Internet)</h2>
<p>This one might seem a little odd, but let’s face it; the news we consume, whether it be through TV or online, is overwhelmingly negative. News doesn’t help us, it worries us, yet we’re enthralled by it—everyday. We don’t need to break down the scientific studies that prove WHY we are more likely to read/listen to negative rather than positive news, but removing news updates from our lives would undoubtedly do us the world of good. We also don’t need to get granular about what constitutes ‘news’, because people might perceive this differently. Once again however, I was beginning to miss my morning routine of waking up with BBC Breakfast. I only managed to shield myself from world news for about a week. I’m going to attempt this again one day for sure.</p>
<p>Side note: I recently discovered <a href="https://www.notdepressing.com" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Not Depressing News</a>. Enjoy.</p>
<h2>9. Phone in the Evening (19:00-06:00)</h2>
<p>Prior to September, I was falling into a bad habit of using my phone quite often in the evenings. This would include emailing, mindlessly browsing social media, and taking calls. I wanted to go a month where I could literally switch off in the evenings and spend more time with my girlfriend, but also to find a better balance throughout the day of screen time. It was a good test of discipline and one I managed to get through.</p>
<h2>10. Shaving</h2>
<p>Why would I try to give up shaving for a month? This was simply a test of self-confidence and how I would feel about myself sporting a hipster beard. I have never grown a full beard before, so it was a bit of a scary prospect. I failed. After about two weeks. It was a poor effort, but on to the next month.</p>
<h2>11. Personal/Home Purchases</h2>
<p>This was a test of discipline to achieve a little more financial freedom. It has been a year of some heavy investments, having finally gotten myself on the property ladder and curating my home. However, I still have debts, and so I wanted to exercise my discipline in spending on luxury items, whether it be furniture, home accessories, or personal items like clothing.</p>
<h2>12. Contact Lenses</h2>
<p>No, this was not a test to see if I could survive relying solely on my terrible natural eyesight. With a prescription of -4.25/-4.75, I’m not sure I would get by too well. Instead, this was another test of self-confidence and to wear glasses-only, as well as to simply let my eyes breathe for a month. Unfortunately, I fell at this hurdle too. I did wear my glasses more often, but sometimes it’s not that practical.</p>
<p>If you have attempted something similar, I’d love to hear your experience.</p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>Generally speaking, side projects are great things. They offer us opportunities to create something new. Sometimes these are merely hobbies and sometimes these are projects we’d like to pursue as a potential career. They all have to start somewhere, right?</p>
<p>Over the past five years or so, I’ve been involved in quite a few side projects, but the only two of great significance are <a href="https://minimalissimo.com" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Minimalissimo</a> and <a href="https://minimalism.life" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Minimalism Life</a>. These are projects that are challenging both from a creative perspective as well as a sustainability one. Towards the end of 2018 however, I came to the realisation that I was too distracted and spreading myself too thin with my day job as a web &amp; UX designer, managing the aforementioned side projects, as well as working on a couple of other smaller scale projects. I told myself that if I am going to make these two projects true successes, I need to ensure I can dedicate enough time to them—giving them as much focus as I can in order to make them thrive. That means turning down anything new. For now.</p>
<p>New projects excite me though, so it’s not always easy saying “no” to opportunities, but if minimalism has taught me anything, it is to say “no” to many things, so I can say “yes” to the right things.</p>
<p>2019 is going to be a year of less distraction, more discipline, and more focus. Less, but better and with purpose.</p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>All design should be simple for users to understand. However, simplicity in design is one of the most difficult things to do well—to find a balance between intuitive functionality and aesthetics. And yet ironically, design that appears effortless often takes far more work than something that appears complicated—more so in design thinking, than design doing.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Simplicity is the key to excellence.” </p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: right">– Dieter Rams</p>
<p>We naturally overcomplicate things we don’t understand. This is typically the root of over-engineered design. If it can’t be explained simply, it can’t be made simply. We often think adding things makes a thing better, but more often than not, it’s quite the opposite. Continually adding gives the impression of development, and in many cases that is accurate, but design that focuses on a product’s essence—without distraction—is always going to be better.</p>
<p>Yet, simplicity has a stigma attached to it. Often commented upon with “that looks like it was made in five minutes” or “I could have done that” — and maybe that’s true, but it’s easy to observe a finished product and overlook the skill involved in making it. Skill that has been learned, development, and shaped over many years of experience.</p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>Focusing our minds is essential to productivity, high performance, and awareness, but our focus is constantly under siege by things grasping for our attention. Some of us may excel in multitasking, but you will undoubtedly perform better with full, selective attention. It’s not exactly supernatural. Our attention is a precious commodity, and it requires protection. Not just by avoiding things that distract us, but also through exercising our attention through techniques like meditation. You might call that mindfulness or cognitive control.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, us humans are keen to please. We say yes to a lot of things because we feel we can fit it all in. It also means we avoid making tough decisions that may disappoint or offend others. But where does that ultimately lead? Well, it leads to several places—one of those being stress, and another being mediocracy.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“You’d think focus means saying yes, but it actually means to say no.” </p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: right">—Steve Jobs</p>
<p>I think the key to being focused is through living by design, and not by default. Meaning that we deliberately make a distinction between the vital few from the trivial many—eliminating everything that is non-essential to us. And it’s this elimination that will drive us to say no to distractions—to the noise.</p>
<p>We can even look at this from a wider standpoint, and analyse what we’re actually saying yes to, and how this not only affects  the tasks we perform, but also the lives we lead. Sometimes we will say ‘yes’ to something that is seemingly important, but by doing so, we are inadvertently saying ‘no’ to things that are even more important—our physical and mental health, our relationships, and even our creativity. Scale it back, be more intentional, and don’t be afraid of saying no—even to the good things.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>Over the past few months I’ve been working on completely redesigning and rebuilding a site from the ground up. This week we launched <a href="https://minimalism.life" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Minimalism Life</a> Version 2, and it’s a project I’m super proud of for several reasons.</p>
<p>The project was initiated by an article I wrote last year on how to <a href="https://cmhb.de/monetising-minimalism" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">monetise a brand</a> with minimalism at its core. This made me entirely re-evaluate Minimalism Life and what we could do with the site. We made the first important decision—to create a premium subscription package. We call this <em>Inside Minimalism</em>. The idea behind that is to write short essays with a small team of experienced writers on wide-ranging topics all with a connection to minimalism. The next question was <em>‘how we do we deliver this content?’</em> After much discussion, we rested on publishing directly to your email inbox. There’s a few decent services out there that manage this kind of thing, and we found one in <a href="https://substack.com" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Substack</a>.</p>
<p>We wanted to maintain some of the features we liked from the previous site, such as our wallpapers and the <a href="https://minimalism.life/journal" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">journal</a>, which is a great way for us to engage with our readers and give them the opportunity to share some of their own personal stories. </p>
<p>So we now had a very simple idea of what Minimalism Life (V2) would look like, but we wanted to completely rebuild the site from back to front. This included totally changing up our CMS, moving away from the increasingly bloated WordPress and moving to the flexible, file-based, and ultra-lightweight, <a href="https://getkirby.com" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Kirby</a>. The build was all managed by <a href="https://manuelmoreale.com" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Manu Moreale</a>, who’s got great experience with Kirby and so he built a super-clean admin panel for us to work with. It’s all remarkably simple to use, and even simpler to maintain.</p>
<p>As for the design, I wanted the site to breathe—to be calm, clear, and focused on what it offers you. That meant introducing a lot of white space, contrast, and intuitive design components. I didn’t want to hide anything in a drawer, because that’s just an excuse to hide mess. Instead, I wanted to show everything we had to offer without being visually obtrusive. To achieve that, I had to be aggressively minimal with the design.</p>
<p>This was then coded entirely by Manu in a typically lite fashion, which has resulted in a much faster and easily maintainable site. You can get a bit more of a technical breakdown on his <a href="https://manuelmoreale.com/minimalism-life" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">blog</a>.</p>
<p>As our site is focused on the written word, it’s really important to use a font that is readable and well-designed. Although we have been using Campton for all our minimal maxims on social media, we didn’t feel this worked as a typeface for the new site, so we made the decision to change it. We finally chose <a href="https://typetype.org/fonts/commons/" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">TT Commons</a> by TypeType. This will now become the typeface we use for all creative material.</p>
<p>Finally, we decided to refresh all our <a href="https://minimalism.life/wallpapers" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">wallpapers</a>—this time with a mix of shapes and inspirational quotes. Although some people might appreciate a quote as a visual reminder on their phone or desktop, I also wanted to introduce some simple, geometric shapes that would work well as wallpapers. This series will grow over time, but there’s a small selection available for you to freely download today.</p>
<p>It’s going to be difficult to predict how successful this new approach is going to be for <a href="https://minimalism.life" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Minimalism Life</a>, but it’s certainly going to be an exciting year.</p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>The second project of the year has successfully shipped: <a href="https://minimalissimo.shop" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Minimalissimo Shop Version 2</a>.</p>
<p>I don’t know why I held WordPress in such high regard for so many years—it’s Starbucks of the CMS world. So migrating my sites over to <a href="https://getkirby.com" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Kirby</a> is a great feeling. The latest of which was the Minimalissimo Shop. It was a fun little project I worked on with <a href="https://manuelmoreale.com" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Manu Moreale</a>.</p>
<p>We wanted to simplify the design, but most importantly, we wanted to simplify the shopping cart and checkout process. So we decided to build a super-lite backend with Kirby to house the product catalogue, and integrate a <a href="https://www.shopify.co.uk" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Shopify</a> cart and checkout. It was really as simple as that.</p>
<p>I made the design, and Manu coded it. We also experimented with a new typeface called <a href="https://rsms.me/inter/" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Inter</a> by Rasmus Andersson. It’s a beautiful type design, so I’m seriously considering using this for the next major project, which is a complete overhaul of Minimalissimo.</p>
<p>The only other notable change was a new domain name we bought: <a href="https://minimalissimo.shop" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">minimalissimo.shop</a></p>
<p>A nice touch I think.</p>
<p>From here, besides trying to market the shop a little more effectively, I want to work with other creators and brands to produce designs that are exclusive to the Minimalissimo Shop. So if you’d like to discuss any ideas, please <a href="mailto:&#99;&#109;&#x68;&#98;&#x61;&#x72;&#x65;&#x6e;&#x62;&#x72;&#117;&#103;&#x40;&#103;&#109;&#x61;&#105;&#108;&#x2e;&#x63;&#111;&#109;">get in touch</a>.</p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>I’ve been embedded within the Apple ecosystem for years, using an iMac at home as well as the office, owning an iPhone since the iPhone 3G, and my latest investment was a pair of AirPods—probably Apple’s best product design for years. I was stuck on the iPhone 6s for a long time (an age in tech terms), with none of Apple’s newest designs impressing me enough to justify spending £1k on a phone—particularly because I was looking to be less reliant on my smartphone anyway. I wanted to reduce my screen time. So I was open to change.</p>
<p>Enter <a href="https://www.blloc.com" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Blloc</a>, a tiny independent Berlin-based tech company who created a smartphone to combat the growing addictive behaviour we have with our phones. Designed for minimalists—or at least for those who actively want to take a minimalist approach to their phone usage—<a href="https://minimalissimo.shop/product/blloc" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Blloc</a>, which runs on Android, offers a truly simplified user experience and gives greater control to its users. The monochromatic menus and the bespoke Lines™ icons bring a unique aesthetic to the UI. It’s so brilliantly refreshing not to have overly-colourful and over-designed apps vying for my attention. It has two modes: MNML and BLLOC Mode, with the latter offering an unobtrusive, quiet, and customisable experience.</p>
<p>The performance of Blloc OS is decent. Of course it could be faster, but it’s not alarmingly slow that it builds any type of frustration. This will hopefully improve with every update, and given their past releases, the signs are there to support this.</p>
<p>The Blloc hardware is understated and sleek. It’s not dissimilar to an iPhone X, but instead uses a plastic back casing instead of glass, and features a fingerprint sensor, which I’ve always liked as a security feature. It does also offer a headphone jack, despite measuring just 7.7mm in thickness, catering to those who insist on living the wired life.</p>
<p>Besides the relaxing monochromatic UI, and the clean line iconography and system fonts, one of the most distinctive features of the phone is the Colour Touch technology. Regardless of which app I’m using, with a simple tap of the fingerprint sensor, it smoothly transitions the display to full colour. I simply tap again to switch it back to monochrome.</p>
<p>My biggest gripe with the phone is the gestures, particularly the swipe to go back gesture. You have to be pretty precise with your finger position, so I'd love to see more work done to this area of the OS.</p>
<p>I’m really excited to see the development of <a href="https://minimalissimo.shop/product/blloc" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Blloc</a> throughout the year. It’s great value, I love the concept, and I love what they’ve achieved so far with a relatively modest team.</p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<blockquote>
<p>“The home is what a bear would know as a cave. It's a space to be an animal, really. You can chew your bone in the corner and nobody will bother you. It's a laboratory for living—it's fluid.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: right">—Michele Oka Doner</p>
<p>Your home is your sanctuary, yet it's not a space that you should ever feel confined. It should never give you a sense of strain or anxiousness—rather, it should be a tranquil space that comforts you and helps you reset. It's a space you control (admittedly to varying degrees depending on your living circumstances). A space you can manipulate, curate, and clear-out.</p>
<p>Reducing what you own simplifies your home. It means having fewer things to clean, maintain, and replace. You may not want an easy life, but you're likely to want to live a simpler life, and the best place to start is where you wake up every day. Allow yourself to let go to regain control.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>I have always appreciated the practice of meditation and what it can do for the mind, including how it can help control our emotions. I've been reading up on it a little more recently and have spoken to some friends who also practice it, so I was really interested in giving it a go. Well, now I am giving it a go.</p>
<p>I want to ease myself into it by practicing for a short period everyday. For the next month, I will get up at 06:15 and meditate for 10 minutes, hopefully free of disturbance and distraction. My cats might have other plans, but we’ll see.</p>
<p>Because this is so new to me, I think it’s really useful to experience guided meditations, so I decided to download the app  ‘<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.wakingup.android&amp;hl=en_GB" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Waking Up with Sam Harris</a>’, which a number of people have recommended to me. Although I’m going to begin with 10 minute sessions first thing in the morning, I do plan to eventually book-end the day with another 10 minute session in the evening, which my friend, Zen Buddhist, and meditation teacher <a href="https://ando.life" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Andō</a> suggested I try.</p>
<p>Although I do see myself as a calm and collected person, I do experience anxiety, stress, and agitation from time to time, so I do feel there’s a lot of value I can get out of practising meditation. I’ll publish a follow-up to this in a few months time to share my experience.</p>
<p>If you’re already practicing, what works well for you? How did you start and how do you practice today? <a href="mailto:&#x63;&#x6d;&#104;&#98;&#x61;&#114;&#x65;&#110;&#x62;&#x72;&#117;&#x67;&#64;&#103;&#109;&#x61;&#x69;&#108;&#46;&#99;&#x6f;&#109;">Let me know</a>.</p>]]></description>

            <title>Learning a Second Language</title>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>How I envy polyglots. They have remarkable minds, and a remarkable dedication to learning. How some people are capable and proficient in reading, writing, and speaking several languages, baffles me. Just being able to retain that magnitude of information on top of everything else learned day-to-day is mightily impressive. Not that I have any desires to become a polyglot, but I do have a desire to be bilingual.</p>
<p>British people are notoriously terrible at learning a second language, let alone several. I’m ashamed to say that I am one such case. Yes, I’d get by just fine relying solely on English. I certainly don’t need to learn any other languages, but that’s not really the point.</p>
<p>In the past, I’ve attempted and failed to learn a second language on more than one occasion. I tried French (first introduced through school), I tried Polish (because of my partner), and I tried German (because I am half German anyway and felt a stronger connection to it than other languages). Although I found French the easier of the three (and can still remember a reasonable amount), I have decided to focus on learning German. It’s a decision I made at the start of the year, not only because of my heritage, but because I do see myself living in the country at some point in the future. I’m also in the process of obtaining a German passport (for political reasons, but let’s not get into that).</p>
<p>The next question was what method(s) should I use to learn? I decided to download the highly-rated <a href="https://www.memrise.com" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Memrise</a> app, which I bought a subscription for. It’s a brilliant app, which teaches common words, phrases, spelling, grammar, pronunciation, as well as learning with locals. So over the past month, I have allocated 10-15 minutes every day to learn through the app. It’s short enough so it doesn’t feel like a chore, and long enough to allow me to actually learn something, if only five new words per day.</p>
<p>My intention is to continue with the <a href="https://www.memrise.com" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Memrise</a> app until I feel I have exhausted it, then I’ll revisit my old Michel Thomas materials I bought many years ago. Beyond that, I’d like to experience one-on-one sessions with a native speaker, and maybe also practice speaking over Skype with a couple of German friends.</p>
<p>When will that be? I have absolutely no idea and I’m not setting a timeline, but I’ve been pretty disciplined with my learning so far, so I do feel confident that I’ll see this challenge through. And that’s exactly how I see it—a life challenge that I’ll feel immensely proud of if achieved.</p>
<p>Wünsch mir Glück!</p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>The idea of selling digital products is growing on me. Firstly, the simplicity and speed of delivering a digital product is far greater than that of a physical one—logistically speaking. Secondly, and probably most importantly, the zero shipping costs involved, and all the risk, stress, and uncertainty that is alleviated. This is also significantly better for the customer. On top of that, refunds and returns are comparatively easier.</p>
<p>When running an online drop-ship shop, selling physical products is really challenging, unless you’re turning over very healthy profits and can afford all the services you need to streamline the process and shipping overheads. Unfortunately, I’m not in that position when it comes to the <a href="https://minimalissimo.shop" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Minimalissimo Shop</a>, so to reduce these overheads and logistical complications, I’m gravitating towards <a href="https://minimalissimo.shop/product/minimalissimo-no2-digital" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">digital products</a>.</p>
<p>Initially, I’ll be testing the waters with digital versions of the Minimalissimo magazine editions (once the printed copies have sold out). I also want to explore website themes for <a href="https://a.paddle.com/v2/click/1129/36163?link=1546" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Kirby</a>. Besides that, I would be open to selling other digital magazines, apps, fonts, or presets.</p>
<p>This is not to say I don’t still appreciate physical products. I plan to continue making print editions of the magazine, as well as other accessories such as the <a href="https://minimalissimo.shop/product/minimalissimo-watch" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">archetypal watch</a>, but if I want to continue running an online shop, I want to enjoy it. Digital products makes for a simpler business and a simpler life. And for that reason, I’m sold.</p>
<p>If you’ve got a digital product that you think would be a good fit for the Minimalissimo Shop, or if you want to collaborate on a product design, let me know.</p>
<p><em>Update: We just released two Kirby themes designed for bloggers: <a href="https://minimalissimo.shop/product/minimalist-writer" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Minimalist Writer</a> and <a href="https://minimalissimo.shop/product/minimalist-writer-ii" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Minimalist Writer II</a></em></p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>In the world of digital product design, trusting your gut might not be considered the most responsible thing to do, particularly given that we have access to a ridiculous amount of analytical data to support 99% of the decisions we make. Now, I’m not against data-driven decisions—far from it. They are fundamental to measuring behaviour and discovering what works well and what doesn’t. It also provides an indisputable argument against those with unsubstantiated suggestions on what they would consider a better approach.</p>
<p>That said, if we base all our decisions on data, we lose our sense of creativity and innovation. We take fewer risks. We care more about numbers than we do about the things we make. We live to serve optimisation, performance, accessibility, conversion, and SEO reports. Of course, we need these tools to measure how suitable our products are for the general populace, but I still believe in trusting my intuition for certain things. However, we can only find this trust through experience. Through failures and through successes.</p>
<p>Intuition is not knowledge. It is a feeling. And it’s not always right, but it’s an emotion that adjusts and evolves over time. Sometimes it comes down to confidence in yourself whether or not to run with your gut, sometimes it comes down to the confidence of others, and the rest of the time it comes down to the accuracy of reporting tools. I believe intuition has a place in our decision making process, the same way collecting data has, but what I think is more important is having the conviction to choose one way or the other.</p>
<p>I’m currently facing a tough balance of analytics and creative direction as I undertake a massive overhaul of <a href="https://minimalissimo.com" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Minimalissimo</a>. Many of the decisions are based on data, but other aspects, particularly from a design perspective, are based on personal preference and intuition. I guess every decision made is a risk to a certain extent, supported or otherwise. Time (and analytics) will tell if it all goes to shit, or whether things have changed for the better.</p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>Ever since I moved from the iPhone to the <a href="https://minimalissimo.shop/product/blloc" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Blloc Phone</a>, I wanted to further reduce the number of apps I had installed. Not just because I wanted to reduce my screen time and have fewer distractions, but because I wanted to remove my digital clutter, and where better to start than on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B0dC74fhOJy/" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">my smartphone</a>? I’m currently down to 28 apps in total, which I think is a decent number in this day and age.</p>
<h2>Work</h2>
<ul class="order">
<li>Gmail</li>
<li>Beezee (to-do list)</li>
<li>Dropbox</li>
<li>Dropbox Paper</li>
<li>Slack</li>
</ul>
<h2>Entertainment</h2>
<ul class="order">
<li>YouTube</li>
<li>Amazon Music</li>
<li>Instagram</li>
<li>Twitter</li>
</ul>
<h2>Basics</h2>
<ul class="order">

<li>Google Calendar</li>
<li>Google Maps</li>
<li>Google Photos</li>
<li>Calculator</li>
<li>Phone</li>

<li>Contacts</li>

<h2>Other Tools</h2>
<ul class="order">
<li>PayPal</li>
<li>RBS (banking)</li>
<li>Memrise (learning German)</li>
<li>Waking Up (meditation)</li>
<li>Bus &amp; Trams (in Edinburgh)</li>
</ul>
<p>Reading through this list, I know I could pare this down even further—probably by another half dozen. But then I tell myself that minimalism is about intentionality, not deprivation, so as long as they are used fairly regularly and serve a purpose, they can remain. How does your phone setup look? I’m particularly interested if you also own a <a href="https://minimalissimo.shop/product/blloc" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Blloc Phone</a>.</p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<blockquote>
<p>Balance is a really tricky word, because I don’t think there’s such a thing. There’s just time. There’s just where you are and what you do. And it doesn’t make sense for me to have to spend time on something that feels like a sacrifice. I try to do things that are part of the big thing. You get to pick what your big thing is going to be.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: right">—Seth Godin</p>
<p>I often get asked how I manage to balance my work with my personal life. I don’t even know if I manage it successfully, but I do know I don’t feel overwhelmed by it, which is definitely a good thing. You see, I have very few personal responsibilities, which gives me the opportunity to do a lot with my time. I work full-time as a Web &amp; UX Designer—that’s what supports my lifestyle. Not entirely, but for the most part. I also run a couple of small side projects in <a href="https://minimalissimo.com" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Minimalissimo</a> and <a href="https://minimalism.life" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Minimalism Life</a>, which on the face of it, appear far grander than just side projects. This work essentially amounts to two full-time jobs, so it means I have to carefully allocate my time to do things efficiently and without stressing myself out. I’m not nearly as efficient as I’d like to be though—I’m not a cyborg... yet.</p>
<p>Then there’s my personal life. I’m in a committed and supportive relationship, but we’re both relatively independent, so we don’t demand too much of one another. I can’t say the same about my two cats though. Being Burmese, they are very demanding, but utterly amazing at the same time. I am also fortunate enough to live close to my family, which is really important to me. I make sure I see them once a fortnight for a quiet catch-up.</p>
<p>Then there’s everything else.</p>
<p>My mental and physical health are extremely important to me. I treat these as priorities, so these are very much reflected in the time I dedicate to them. I spend around 3-4 hours at the gym per week, and another 4-6 hours at the climbing gym. I’ve become a little obsessed with bouldering and lead climbing in recent months. But this fitness and strength training goes well beyond the physical benefits—it is time in virtual solitude that clears my mind of most things and helps me to focus on the present.</p>
<p>Then there’s entertainment. I try to squeeze in a TV series throughout the week, but if I don’t have time, it doesn’t bother me. Shows can be watched any time. Prioritising them is ridiculous—for anyone. It’s not a particular show that relaxes you. It’s the act of doing nothing that does.</p>
<p>Finally, there’s sleep. Probably the most important and under appreciated block of time we have in the 24 hour day. Yet, this is one area I’m lacking. I just started reading a book titled, <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Why-We-Sleep-Science-Dreams/dp/0141983760/ref=sr_1_1?hvadid=3170960779&amp;hvbmt=be&amp;hvdev=c&amp;hvqmt=e&amp;keywords=why+we+sleep&amp;qid=1570093053&amp;sr=8-1" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Why We Sleep</a>, by Matthew Walker. It’s not exactly a page-turner, but it can be life-changing. It outlines the importance sleep has on all aspects of our life and how severely damaging a lack of sleep can have on our body and mind. If not today, later in life. It also has some great advice on how we can make changes to experience better sleep. We should all be getting at least 8 hours of sleep per night. I’m not. I get around 7. So I need to get my shit together and treat sleep as a priority.</p>
<p>Much like Seth Godin, I don’t find what I do with my time a sacrifice. Sure, there are minutes throughout the day that can be completely wasted, but we’re not all monks with unwavering self-discipline. This isn’t so much a work/life balance. It’s just life. How I choose to spend it impacts every aspect of what I do.</p>
<p>So what is the “big thing” for me? I suppose I’m still figuring it out, but there is at least a distinct silhouette.</p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>Are we spending enough time with people we can really learn from? Are we having enough conversations that move us forward rather than discussing the mundane things in life?</p>
<p>We are all seeking better connections—some people even the smallest of them. Today, we have the greatest opportunity and freedom to connect with people in every corner of the world (unless you’re in China). Yet, we struggle. We struggle to find worthwhile connections and conversations with those we can learn from and engage meaningfully with. It’s difficult to know why exactly. There’s probably many reasons—work, personal commitments, not knowing where to find them, or too afraid to even seek them out.</p>
<p>For me, most of the people I connect with is done through means of a tweet, an email, or an Instagram DM. It’s a little bit limiting. Some of the most meaningful conversations I have are with people I’ve never even met in person. Whether it’s talking daily to a friend over a messenger app or occasionally arranging a call with someone in the same or similar industry to mine, I almost always come away from that interaction with some value. Would that connection be better in person? It's highly likely, but it's also often totally impractical.</p>
<p>We often get lost in the demands of everyday life. Keeping our heads above water. Keeping our projects alive. Staying up-to-date with news. We do this because it’s important—it’s necessary. And many of us are content listening to our favourite podcasts and reading our favourite blogs. And that’s great. We can discover and learn tonnes from those mediums. Yet, interacting with people live can often change the way we process information. It can renew our enthusiasm. It can help us be more creative. It can open up new opportunities. Other mediums can offer the same thing, but perhaps not to the same extent or with the same intensity.</p>
<p>I want to learn more, but in a better way. I might just reach out a little more intentionally in the future. There’s plenty of great conversations to be had.</p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>It may came as no surprise that one of the most influential figures in my life (whether he knows it or not) is the renowned German industrial designer, <a href="https://www.vitsoe.com/gb/about/dieter-rams" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Dieter Rams</a>. His work speaks for itself and has been the inspiration behind many product designs we use and love today. Rams recently attended the opening of the new Vitsœ shop at 21 Marylebone Lane, London. I was planning on attending this event as well, but due to other commitments, I was unable to. Anyway, while there, Dieter and managing director Mark Adams had an interesting <a href="https://www.vitsoe.com/gb/voice/has-anyone-been-listening" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">conversation</a> on the current state of design, consumer behaviour, and the environmental impact of our creation and consumption. I quote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The word ‘design’. It has become inflationary in the last few years—everybody understands other things under the name of design. I am always fighting against this because I don’t think the English name is correct. It is applied to some terrible things—it is inflated. Let’s change the name design to the German word Gestaltung. Kindergarten is a common word in English nowadays so why not Gestaltung too? Design as a term and definition used today is inflationary and often misapplied.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As a designer myself, this really resonated with me because he’s absolutely right. The word ‘design’ is frequently misused, much like the word ‘minimal’ is also. Quite often, I suspect this essentially comes down to a sheer misunderstanding of what design actually means.</p>
<p>So what is Gestaltung exactly? According to Rams, it is observing, thinking, and understanding. It is also strongly related to three basic principles expressed by Roman architect Marcus Vitruvius Pollio: Firmitas (engineering), Utilitas (science), Venustas (aesthetics).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>These basic principles, together with the state of our current knowledge of technology, ergonomics, sociology, ecology, psychology, and philosophy, and influenced by the three different dimensions, are the new functional Gestaltung.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These areas then feed into an interdisciplinary approach to the design process, whether it’s design thinking, user experience, usability, or eco design. Collectively, these are implicit in the process of Gestaltung.</p>
<p>To make better design, we must think as Gestalters. We must consider what it means and what it takes in order to create good, long-lasting products. And by that, I mean considering more than the function of a thing, more than the aesthetics of a thing, and more than the profitability of a thing.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The times of thoughtless design, which can only flourish in times of thoughtless production for thoughtless consumption, are over. We cannot afford any more thoughtlessness.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Long live Gestaltung!</p>]]></description>

            <title>10 Years of Minimalissimo</title>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>Has <a href="https://minimalissimo.com" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Minimalissimo</a> really been running for 10 years?! It's a question I've asked myself more than once. It's something I'm incredibly proud of actually. Running and sustaining a high-calibre site like this is not easy. It requires a lot of dedication, love, and most importantly, consistency. There's no doubt in my mind that beyond the consistency of publishing the best in minimal art and design, we have continued to improve our curation and editorial quality over the years. Yes, user behaviour has evolved since 2009 in terms of how readers consume digital content, but there's a lot to be said for sites that can stand strong amongst a sea of social media profiles, design blogs, and digital magazines. Minimalissimo does that—and does it well.</p>
<p>So to celebrate our 10 year anniversary, we have made some big changes. We have rebuilt the <a href="https://minimalissimo.com" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Minimalissimo</a> site from front to back.</p>
<p>But first, how did this niche site start?</p>
<p>Minimalissimo started back in 2009 by Maarten Kappert and Stan Grootes. They created something pretty special and something very different at the time—a place where readers can simply come and spend hours, immersed in the diversity of some great minimalist art and design. This was before the days of mass social media such as Instagram and Pinterest, so it was a great resource for people looking to discover simple, interesting designs as well as inspiration. I joined the team as an editor back in 2011, and subsequently took it over later that year. Minimal design was something I was becoming increasingly passionate about, so it was a good opportunity and challenge for me to see where I could take the site, if even working on it part-time (which I continue to do to this day).</p>
<p>From there, I’ve done my best to drive the site forward, working with some talented and committed curators and writers, a complete rebrand, three printed magazines, as well as four significant site redesigns (let us forget the 2016 version). It hasn’t been until the last two years that I have really felt that we are on the right path though. I owe a lot of that to <a href="https://manuelmoreale.com" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Manu Moreale</a>—a ridiculously talented web developer and minimalist through and through. Working alongside someone like that has really helped put things into perspective. It is why we now have a wonderful site, coded beautifully, and at the risk of sounding immodest, designed beautifully too.</p>
<p>We have achieved all of this by working <em>entirely</em> remotely. Working remotely is a significant advantage yet also a big challenge. Coordinating an online team across time zones is challenging and can be frustrating at times. While we depend on each other for certain tasks, it doesn’t matter where or when you work as long as you get the work done.</p>
<p>Since 2009, when blogging was at its height, we were generating some serious traffic to the site. Considering how the web has evolved over the last decade, it’s natural and completely expected that site traffic will lessen, unless you invest thousands, if not millions, into advertising and marketing. We don’t do that—at all. Yet, here we are, still going strong.</p>
<p>So let’s take a look at what Version 5 of Minimalissimo looks like:</p>
<figure class="img-figure"><div class="img-wrapper" data-tooltip="Minimalissimo homepage" style="padding-bottom: 67.857142857143%"><img alt="Minimalissimo homepage" class="img" loading="lazy" src="https://carlbarenbrug.com/media/pages/blog/ten-years-of-minimalissimo/760ec02533-1690029219/9.jpg"></div></figure>
<figure class="img-figure"><div class="img-wrapper" data-tooltip="Moods" style="padding-bottom: 67.857142857143%"><img alt="Moods" class="img" loading="lazy" src="https://carlbarenbrug.com/media/pages/blog/ten-years-of-minimalissimo/6969fcfb98-1690029219/6.jpg"></div></figure>
<figure class="img-figure"><div class="img-wrapper" data-tooltip="Inside Minimalissimo" style="padding-bottom: 67.857142857143%"><img alt="Inside Minimalissimo" class="img" loading="lazy" src="https://carlbarenbrug.com/media/pages/blog/ten-years-of-minimalissimo/53090b623a-1690029218/3.jpg"></div></figure>
<h2>Our New CMS</h2>
<p>We have been using WordPress since we started, but we scrapped that and went for a much better fit: <a href="https://getkirby.com" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Kirby</a>. This is an incredibly flexible and lightweight content management system that has no database, and instead uses a file-based structure. We completely customised the backend admin panel, which we use to edit and publish our content. You probably don't care about this part, but it's a massive change for us, and a fantastic one at that. If you have any questions about it, then drop a note to our web developer <a href="https://manuelmoreale.com" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Manu</a>.</p>
<h2>Our New Site Design</h2>
<p>Our design is very different, but also quite familiar. It is actually somewhat similar to our original site design back in 2009, but has a lot more design precision, it's lighter, and has a markedly improved performance than all our previous versions, which ultimately improves the overall reading experience.</p>
<h2>Structure</h2>
<p>Our editorial structure has changed a little. We have decided to have a more streamlined editorial approach. We are focusing our features on a smaller range of disciplines and topics, which are highlighted in the main menu. We went with this approach after inviting readers to engage in a survey to express what they liked, disliked, and wanted to see more of. Our feature articles will offer a deep-dive into projects, as opposed to our previous short-form overviews.</p>
<p>In addition, we are treating <a href="https://minimalissimo.com/creators" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">creator interviews</a> with greater prominence. We came to the conclusion that in general, people enjoy reading about people more than things. So we want to get to know creators better—their approach to design, work processes, learning outcomes, and life outside of the studio.</p>
<p>A brand new feature we have introduced is our <a href="https://minimalissimo.com/moods" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Moods</a> section. This is essentially a visual-only curation of moods of wide-ranging topics. It's a great space for visual-inspiration and experimentation without the editorial.</p>
<h2>Grid System</h2>
<p>Our grid system is perhaps the biggest design change. We are using a combination of both flex and inline-blocks items. The grid works superbly on all display sizes—from the ultra wide desktop to the little smartphone. We are applying strict aspect ratios to all imagery for consistency. These are 3:2 (landscape), 2:3 (portrait), and 1:1 (square).</p>
<h2>Typography</h2>
<p>We have decided to change up our typeface too. Far the past 3 years or so, we have been using Avenir by Adrian Frutiger. This was used in both print and digital materials. We have now decided to use Inter by Rasmus Andersson. We felt this offers a wonderful reading experience across all displays and sizes, it has a very extensive library, and it's continually supported. We will also be applying Inter to our upcoming printed magazine editions.</p>
<h2>Shop Integration</h2>
<p>We recently launched our <a href="https://minimalissimo.shop" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">online shop</a>, which includes a very small curation of both physical and digital products. This is an ongoing project that we'll continue to develop over the course of next year. Not many of our readers know we even have a shop, so we wanted to integrate this a little more seamlessly into our principle site. However, we have taken a very mindful and considerate approach with this. We do not want our shop to be obtrusive to your reading experience, which I think has been achieved pretty well.</p>
<h2>Newsletter (finally)</h2>
<p>Has it really taken 10 years for us to create a newsletter? I don't really have a good answer as to why it has taken so long to do this, but as far as I'm concerned, it's better late than never. Hopefully you feel the same way. Plus, I think it's better to have readers who are interested in our content now.</p>
<p>So what will this letter offer? With as little design as possible, this will be a weekly email recapping features published that week on our site, as well as highlighting a particular project from our archive and a product in our shop. We'll also be sharing insights into planned projects, creator stories, and exclusive offers only available to subscribers. We'll probably introduce new features throughout the year as well—we're new to this you see.</p>
<h2>Performance</h2>
<p>As for performance, there's nothing special going on, but we have tried to keep our code as lightweight as possible. Our new server uses Nginx as the webserver, content is served via http2 and uses brotli compression. We're running latest php version, and we're using memcache to cache the content. SSL is provided by Let's Encrypt. Other than that, the site is just a simple site with no 3rd party services or anything else. You could say we have taken a minimalist approach in every aspect of this site build. And I for one, love that. I hope you enjoy it too.</p>
<p>I also want to thank all the readers who take time out of their day to visit <a href="https://minimalissimo.com" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Minimalissimo</a>. The feedback, encouragement, and enthusiasm shown motivates me to keep making Minimalissimo better. For another 10 years, and maybe more.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>Many people are choosing to slowly improve, enhance, and invigorate their living spaces by making subtle but significant changes to their homes with the addition of good quality, easily transportable furniture and fittings. Even those who are not home owners are taking this approach to home curation. After all, it’s not exactly difficult to move furniture from one place to another.</p>
<p>I see my home as a sanctuary—a small (67sqm), quiet place that is ever-evolving, but one that offers everything I need in a practical sense, but also to consistently feel calm, comfortable, and creative—an intentional refuge from the chaotic outside world that is obviously out of my control. I have a very reductive aesthetic with neutral tones and ample nature throughout. The volume is always low—both audibly and visually. My choices of furniture over the last couple of years reflect this. I’ve taken an approach to interior design that is representative of simple and slow living, although I appreciate that might mean something entirely different from one person to the next.</p>
<p>Investing in the right furniture for your home tends to be a very gradual process. It certainly is for me. Not least due to finances, but also because of the way we live. We are always changing as people, so our home requirements must also change as we do. Over the years I’ve gotten to know a handful of furniture designers and brands that I really admire—in terms of their design aesthetics, their philosophies, but most importantly, their build quality. Whatever investments I make for my home, I want them to be as long-lasting as possible. Obviously, I have a responsibility to look after the things I own to extend their life-span, but it all starts with the quality of the design itself.</p>
<figure class="img-figure"><div class="img-wrapper" data-tooltip="Living Room" style="padding-bottom: 66.666666666667%"><img alt="Living Room" class="img" loading="lazy" src="https://carlbarenbrug.com/media/pages/blog/home-investments/c9f2f53a4f-1690029222/home.jpg"></div></figure>
<figure class="img-figure"><div class="img-wrapper" data-tooltip="Coffee Table" style="padding-bottom: 66.666666666667%"><img alt="Coffee Table" class="img" loading="lazy" src="https://carlbarenbrug.com/media/pages/blog/home-investments/2930c2b2c5-1690029220/home-coffee-table.jpg"></div></figure>
<p>So looking to the year ahead, I have a few more investments I’d like to make.</p>
<h2>606 Shelving System</h2>
<p>One brand I really admire is Vitsœ. The designs of Dieter Rams are unlike any other. They are beautifully simple, functional, high-quality, and long-lasting. I’m going to invest in a small configuration of the <a href="https://www.vitsoe.com/gb/606" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">606 Universal Shelving System</a> for my home office. This is a space I see myself spending more time in this year, so I want it to work even better for me.</p>
<h2>Ceiling Lamps</h2>
<p>I currently have some horrible spotlights in both the bedroom and office. I do have some excellent table lamps, but the ceiling lamps are awful. Lighting design is so important—in any setting. I’ve yet to actively research which lighting would be the best fit—visually and functionally, but it’s something I feel needs to be addressed this year.</p>
<h2>Cat Tree</h2>
<p>I have two cats (3yo). You’ve probably seen them on my <a href="https://www.instagram.com/barenbrug/" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Instagram</a> feed if you follow me. Now, these two boys are indoor cats (for now), so I want to make their lives as fulfilling as I can. Cats have simple pleasures, so I don’t need to make my home into some crazy cat cave, but I am on the lookout for something for them to climb. I’m sick of them climbing me! I have enough scars as it is. 99% of cat tree designs are horrendous, so this is no easy task. The best one I’ve come across so far is Rinn’s <a href="https://rinn.co.jp/neko/en/" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Neko</a> tree, although if I'm reading the price correctly, it’s a stupid amount of money. The search, therefore, continues.</p>
<p>Other things I have in mind are new lightweight bedroom curtains and an induction hub for the kitchen. Those are pretty minor though.</p>
<p>If you have any design suggestions, please <a href="mailto:&#x63;&#109;&#x68;&#98;&#x61;&#x72;&#x65;&#110;&#98;&#x72;&#117;&#103;&#x40;&#103;&#109;&#97;&#x69;&#x6c;&#x2e;&#x63;&#x6f;&#109;">drop me an email</a>.</p>]]></description>

            <title>Nuances of Minimalism</title>
            <link>https://carlbarenbrug.com/@/page/JLnLh0UIHOvHBYzY</link>
            <guid isPermaLink="false">blog/nuances-of-minimalism</guid>
            <pubDate>Wed, 04 Aug 2021 00:00:00 +0200</pubDate>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>Minimalism can be perceived in different ways, as it should be, because there are in fact many nuances to the movement. Is it even a movement? It’s perhaps better described as a guiding principle. Some of these nuances are highly commercial, some are focused on personal wellbeing and sustainability, and some are simply an appreciation of the aesthetic. As minimalism has been popularised in recent years by the likes of <a href="https://www.instagram.com/mariekondo/" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Marie Kondo</a> and <a href="https://www.theminimalists.com" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">The Minimalists</a>, driven primarily through their respective documentaries on Netflix and what I like to call <em>fast food minimalism</em>, I feel there is a large misconception of what minimalism is. The simple reason is that similar to “sports”, “minimalism” is not one single thing.</p>
<p>It comes as no surprise that minimalism can at times face criticism. On one hand it encourages intentional living, decluttering, and money saving. On the other hand it celebrates high-quality design with often high price tags. You can own less, but you can still spend a lot. At least that’s the shortsighted viewpoint. You see, the cost of a thing goes well beyond the price on the price tag. When we buy something, do we always consider its longevity? Do we consider its environmental impact? Do we consider what it costs to maintain—both monetarily and our time? Do we always ignore our impulses? Now and again, we’re all guilty of answering ‘no’ to these questions, but minimalism (in one form) can help us—it’s a tool that simply raises the awareness of these questions. It puts us on the path to make better and more mindful decisions.</p>
<p>Circling back to minimalism and its nuances, I want to try to paint a clear, concise, and understandable picture of the differences. There are essentially three top level variants:</p>
<ol>
<li>Minimalism in Art</li>
<li>Minimalism in Design</li>
<li>Minimalism in Living</li>
</ol>
<p>Each of these can be broken down further, particularly the latter (living).</p>
<hr />
<h2>Minimalism in Art</h2>
<p>Minimalism identifies works of art most often comprised of geometric shapes in simple arrangements and lacking any decorative or dynamic ornamentation. Minimalist art offers a highly purified form of beauty. It can also be seen as representing such qualities as truth (because it does not pretend to be anything other than what it is), order, simplicity, and harmony. Minimalism in an art form can be seen as extending the abstract idea that art should have its own reality and not be an imitation of some other thing. No attempt is made to represent an outside reality—the artist wants the viewer to respond only to what is in front of them. <em>(Reference courtesy of <a href="https://www.tate.org.uk/art/art-terms/m/minimalism" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Tate</a>)</em></p>
<hr />
<h2>Minimalism in Design</h2>
<p>Minimalist design can be expressed in many forms. It can be almost anything we use. The difference between art and design is simple: design needs to work—art does not.</p>
<p>Minimalism in the design sense is a way to express a function with as little design as possible. It exposes the essence in order to communicate the value, while carefully balancing form and function. I actually wrote an article on <a href="https://cmhb.de/minimal-design" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Five Principles for Minimal Design</a>. This offers further insight into what minimal design is, or perhaps should be, from my perspective.</p>
<p>This area is one that focuses predominantly on aesthetics, simplicity, and usability. Whether it’s a website, a hotel, a smartphone, a chair, a watch, a bicycle, or a vase—it all falls under <em>Minimalism in Design</em> and with varying degrees of extremities. Of course, as this is such a broad term, the value and usability of design can vary wildly too. Some design leans more towards form, others towards function. Either way, it does not make one design inferior to the other by default. Rather, that is determined by details that comprise a design. For example, consider a piece of furniture—a quality product will be determined by the choice of material, how it’s sourced, its environmental impact, and its production process. A digital example might be a website build—many sites may appear minimal on the face, but a high quality minimal site will also be coded well, with as few scripts as possible, heavily optimised, and organised in a readable way, resulting in not just quality and easily maintainable design, but quality performance.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Minimalism in Living</h2>
<p>This area of minimalism is perhaps the most subjective and complicated, but also the most rewarding. As we all lead different lives, there is no one-size-fits-all approach to a minimalist life, and people might only choose to apply certain characteristics (or ingredients) to particular areas of their lives. Someone interested in minimalism could be described as one or several of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Someone looking to declutter their possessions—both physically and digitally.</li>
<li>Someone looking to reduce their spending and save as much money as they can.</li>
<li>Someone who simply enjoys the minimalist aesthetic.</li>
<li>Someone who appreciates minimalist design, but only owns what they feel they need.</li>
<li>Someone living a nomadic lifestyle and owns the bare essentials through necessity and practicality.</li>
<li>Someone looking to simplify their life by removing anything they no longer value—in terms of possessions, commitments, and relationships.</li>
<li>Someone looking to be more intentional, focused, and disciplined with their actions and time.</li>
<li>Someone looking to reduce their environmental footprint and live more sustainably.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>“Minimalism is a lifestyle that helps people question what things add value to their lives. By clearing the clutter from life’s path, we can all make room for the most important aspects of life: health, relationships, passion, growth, and contribution.” </p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: right">—The Minimalists</p>
<p>Asking yourself <a href="https://manuelmoreale.com/mgtm-chapter-one" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">questions</a> helps you to become more self-aware, but it depends on the particular area of your life that you’re looking to address. If, for instance, it’s your physical or digital possessions, you might want to ask:</p>
<ul>
<li>Do I need this?</li>
<li>Do I want this?</li>
<li>Can I optimise this?</li>
<li>Can I do without it? </li>
<li>Are there alternatives?  </li>
<li>Does it add value to my life?</li>
</ul>
<p>You can make a deliberate decision to be a minimalist, or it can be a byproduct of the life you live, and it can evolve over a lifetime.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>I love designing websites. It’s something I’ve been doing for almost 15 years. Yes, I’m that old. Whether basic one pagers or comprehensive sites with design systems, I’ve had the opportunity to create some interesting projects. You could say I’m a multidisciplinary designer, but I do focus primarily on user experience and user interface design. Outside of running <a href="https://minimalissimo.com" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Minimalissimo</a> and my other side projects, it’s what I do on a daily basis. And it’s by designing these side projects with my friend and incredibly talented developer <a href="https://manuelmoreale.com" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Manu Moreale</a>, that we have now managed to build a small yet significant portfolio of projects. Naturally for us, all of these sites embody simplicity in design. So we created something to showcase our work and perhaps expand it further with a few selected projects.</p>
<p>We created <a href="https://simpler.studio" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Simpler</a>. A virtual studio that proposes a simplified and more effective model for designing and implementing digital platforms.</p>
<figure class="img-figure"><div class="img-wrapper" data-tooltip="Simpler Studio" style="padding-bottom: 66.666666666667%"><img alt="Simpler Studio" class="img" loading="lazy" src="https://carlbarenbrug.com/media/pages/blog/simpler/0936728063-1690029222/simpler.jpg"></div></figure>
<p>With Simpler, we only want to work on projects that we’ll genuinely enjoy building—for instance, sites for architects, interior and product designers, and photographers too. So if you want to work with Manu and I on a new project, please <a href="mailto:&#x63;&#x6f;&#x6e;&#116;&#97;&#x63;&#116;&#64;&#x73;&#x69;&#109;&#x70;&#108;&#101;&#114;&#46;&#x73;&#x74;&#x75;&#100;&#x69;&#x6f;">get in touch</a>.</p>]]></description>

            <title>For Digital, For Print</title>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>Over the past decade, the debate between print and digital has been prevalent. For those dedicated to and passionate about print, there is an unwavering defiance and likely stubborn denial that print will come to an end as a means of publication—at least as a profitable one. And yet still the new books and magazines keep coming, still relishing the scent of fresh ink and tactility of paper. That’s not to say there won’t always be a market for it—you simply can not replace the tangible experience of paging through a printed book or magazine. No smartphone, e-reader, or VR headset will achieve that. Simply because those devices are not designed to compete with that experience. They are designed to be more practical, affordable, lightweight, convenient, and accessible.</p>
<p>There will only be one winner when it comes to how the written word is experienced and consumed, but what about art? Digital art certainly has its place in consumerism, but print (or analogue) currently has a stronghold over digital when it comes to experiencing artwork. 50 years from now, that may change drastically, but for now, printed art is not going anywhere soon. A physical screen print, framed, and precisely positioned in a space will have a far greater impact and lasting effect than a digital projection on a wall or a wallpaper on your phone. Of course printed art can originate from a digital creation or even be programmed for robotic technology to perform. That kind of blending of the methods is fascinating. Robotic art has an exciting future, whether in exhibition or in performance.</p>
<p>It can be a tough decision on whether or not to produce a digital product or a printed one. I’m at a bit of a crossroads myself. I am still unsure whether I want the next edition of Minimalissimo magazine to be printed like the three previous, or if I should design it specifically to be read and experienced in a digital format. I do still have a lot of love for print though. I have worked with graphic design consultancy <a href="https://bergerfohr.com" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Berger &amp; F&ouml;hr</a> to produce a very limited edition set of screen prints, which, once printed and framed, will look incredible in any space. More on that when these become available. Maybe I need to do a readership poll. Or maybe I need to go with my gut and take a risk.</p>
<p>If you have any strong opinions on digitised or printed books, magazines, and artworks, please <a href="mailto:&#99;&#x6d;&#x68;&#x62;&#x61;&#x72;&#x65;&#110;&#98;&#114;&#x75;&#103;&#64;&#x67;&#x6d;&#97;&#x69;&#x6c;&#x2e;&#99;&#x6f;&#109;">get in touch</a>.</p>]]></description>

            <title>Good Interviews</title>
            <link>https://carlbarenbrug.com/@/page/yIZD5bHvOpEAJIEZ</link>
            <guid isPermaLink="false">blog/good-interviews</guid>
            <pubDate>Sat, 07 Dec 2020 00:00:00 +0100</pubDate>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>In early 2019, I came to the realisation that people prefer to read about people more than they do about things. It’s not exactly a phenomenon, but it was significant for the editorial direction of <a href="https://minimalissimo.com/" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Minimalissimo</a>. Since relaunching the latest version of the site, you will notice a greater prominence to our creator interviews. I still don’t know if this has or will generate a larger readership, and I don’t care much for analytics. Analytics can be incredibly useful, but I only use the data when I need to. The slight editorial shift was down to instinct more than anything.</p>
<p>So with a greater focus on <a href="https://minimalissimo.com/creators" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">interviews</a>, the work lies in the research of individuals or companies. If you’re interviewing someone who has several interviews previously published online, it’s easy to recycle that content and ask the same old questions, but not only does that add very little value to readers, it also makes it incredibly boring for the interviewee. We want to distinguish forgettable interviews with memorable ones. A good interview is the result of asking good questions off the back of heavy research and avoiding duplication. More than anything though, it’s down to <em>your curiosity</em> and what you want to uncover and know more about.</p>
<h2>The Research</h2>
<p>There’s a big difference between light and heavy research in preparing an interview. Light research will consist of simply visiting the interviewee’s personal or company website and not looking beyond the first page of a Google search.</p>
<p>Heavy research is a little closer to stalking, but obviously, not quite. It involves researching their work, social media profiles, material they have directly published, their industry, reading or watching other interviews they have participated in, and analysing whether their outlook has changed over time so you can ask about certain opinions or creative directions they once expressed. But even if you do want to discuss a topic someone often speaks about, try to find a fresh angle. Off the back of that, you should be able to determine areas you can explore.</p>
<h2>The Questions</h2>
<p>When preparing questions, you want to give an interviewee the opportunity to express their thoughts as fully as possible. So questions need to clearly invite an explanation or description. You want to avoid asking questions that will invite one or two word answers—unless you’re doing some kind of quick fire round on a podcast.</p>
<p>Although it can be and hopefully will be interesting to learn about work and creative processes, these individuals are people. So don’t be afraid to ask one or two personal questions. Needless to say there is also a line here, but try to offer up an opportunity for them to share a bit more about their personality. Almost everyone has interests outside of work. Keep it human and make the interview an enjoyable experience.</p>
<h2>The Format</h2>
<p>Conducting an interview through email is usually far more convenient, practical, and thoughtful than an interview over Skype or in person. Particularly if the interviewee is not a native English speaker. That’s not to say it’s better though. Following-up on responses is far more time-consuming and bothersome over email than adapting in the moment during a live conversation, where you can go off-script to dive into areas you hadn’t planned. That can often lead to an even more compelling interview. Plus, it flows better as a conversation rather than a more rigid template. A useful approach is to send questions ahead of a live interview, so the interviewee has time to prepare some notes on how to answer questions during the discussion.</p>
<p>I think it largely depends on your character and how you interact with people on a daily basis that will determine your preference on how you conduct or participate in interviews.</p>
<p>You might have a preference on how you consume interviews, but there’s definitely no better format than the other. What determines a good interview is down to the research and questions of the person conducting it, and the openness and interest of the individual responding. You can never guarantee a good interview, but you can certainly reduce the chances of it being shit.</p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>As more of us are working remotely—particularly from home—I thought it might be quite timely to break down my current home workspace setup. I’d also like to preface this by saying that I’m not offering any advice or tips for remote working (there’s enough guidance out there to steer you right), but you’re always welcome to ask me something.</p>
<figure class="img-figure"><div class="img-wrapper" data-tooltip="Workspace Setup" style="padding-bottom: 149.95313964386%"><img alt="Workspace Setup" class="img" loading="lazy" src="https://carlbarenbrug.com/media/pages/blog/workspace/a2d828b213-1690029223/workspace-desk-1.jpg"></div></figure>

<h2>The Physical Desk</h2>
<p>My office space is, as you might expect, pretty sparse. The desk is my favourite thing about this workspace. It’s called the <a href="https://lz-elements.com/shop/sinus-family" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Sinus Trestle</a> by L&amp;Z. I basically have six or seven items that sit atop the desk at any one time.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://lz-elements.com/shop/unit/unit-two" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Unit Two Paper Tray</a> by L&amp;Z</li>
<li>Late 2013 Refurbished Apple iMac (display dying after 5 years)</li>
<li>Samsung 27" Space Monitor</li>
<li>Apple Magic Keyboard in Silver</li>
<li>Apple Magic Trackpad 2 in Silver</li>
<li><a href="https://minimalissimo.com/articles/maku-lamp" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Maku Lamp</a> by Kenyon Yeh</li>
<li>iPhone 11</li>
<li>Water Bottle</li>
</ul>
<p>I tend to have a few items in my paper tray as well, like my 500GB (intenso) external drive, Apple Air Pods, and an AJOTO pen.</p>
<h2>The Virtual Desk</h2>
<p>For my desktop, it’s as clean as you can get. I actually use the dynamic gradient wallpaper that comes with macOS Catalina, which I think is really soothing on the eyes. My app dock is always hidden by default and only pops up on mouse hover. This not only helps me focus on the app in use, limiting distraction, but it also allows me to appreciate the desktop artwork so much more. The only files that visit the virtual desk are screenshots. And even then, I remove them immediately after they’ve served their purpose.</p>
<p>When my dock is visible, I only keep the essentials in there.</p>
<ul>
<li>Finder</li>
<li>Launcher</li>
<li>Mail</li>
<li>Safari</li>
<li>iA Writer</li>
<li>Photoshop</li>
<li>Sketch</li>
<li>Visual Studio Code</li>
<li>Downloads</li>
<li>Bin</li>
</ul>
<p>Most of my time is spent in the browser (primarily Safari), where I also use the web version of Slack. Probably less resource heavy and it also means there’s fewer apps I need to download. I also try to avoid storing too much on my iMac. I’ve used less than 25% of 1TB storage.</p>
<p>This is a very light and simple setup, and it works extremely well for me. I don’t need anything more. And before you mention, I do have an office plant. It’s a bonsai that sits on my windowsill.</p>
<p>I hope you’re managing well wherever you’re working from these days. If you do have any questions or want some guidance, I’m happy to help. Just <a href="mailto:&#99;&#x6d;&#x68;&#x62;&#x61;&#114;&#101;&#x6e;&#x62;&#x72;&#x75;&#103;&#64;&#x67;&#109;&#97;&#105;&#108;&#46;&#x63;&#111;&#x6d;">drop me an email</a>.</p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>Whether we like it or not, we are currently living more isolated lives, and for some people a life of solitude. There’s massive disruption. When the world faces a global pandemic, we all have important decisions to make. Some of these are reactive and some of these are responsive. A friend of mine, <a href="https://www.joshuanhook.com" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Joshua Hook</a>, explains the difference really well:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Reacting is fast; responding is slow.</em> When I react, I do it right away. It’s a quick decision, a snap judgment. When I respond, I take my time. It’s a slower process. There is some time and space between my urge to act and my action.</li>
<li><em>Reacting is unconscious; responding is conscious.</em> When I react, it’s almost as if there’s something unconscious pushing me toward a certain direction. I don’t do much thinking about it. When I respond, it’s a conscious process. I weigh my options and then move forward.</li>
<li><em>Reacting is extreme; responding is balanced.</em> When I react, I tend to go to extremes. I do something and do it all the way. Sometimes I even go overboard. When I respond, it’s usually more balanced. I might take a small step in one direction and then see how it goes.</li>
<li><em>The choice to react happens in my own head; responding often involves other people.</em> When I react, I don’t get any feedback from others. There isn’t enough time, I just make a decision and go with it. When I respond, I often have the chance to ask other people in my life what they think. I’m able to get feedback and incorporate it into my response.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now is the time for slow and simple living. It’s a time and a great opportunity to pause or even reset—to take some time to think about the situation and what you want to do. We can create new routines and habits. We can make time to learn. We can make time to communicate when distraction prevented us. We can ask more questions. We can better appreciate how to contribute to society. We can care for our loved ones more deeply. We can better appreciate the importance of exercise and our physical well-being. We can find calm in the middle of a storm.</p>
<p>For some people, life is now about living with less. Not out of choice, but out of necessity. For others, it’s an opportunity to simplify and appreciate the things previously taken for granted—like time (not toilet paper). And for everyone, it’s a time for calmness, compassion, and contribution.</p>]]></description>

            <title>White Space</title>
            <link>https://carlbarenbrug.com/@/page/f8wuRzqfjnrPGZ6Z</link>
            <guid isPermaLink="false">blog/white-space</guid>
            <pubDate>Sat, 07 Dec 2020 00:00:00 +0100</pubDate>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>You’ve probably heard the term ‘white space’ before, which is also often referred to as negative space and is used widely in digital and print design. <em>It is the portion of a canvas left unmarked: margins, gutters, and space between columns, lines of type, graphics, figures, or objects drawn or depicted.</em> It’s an important element of design, which plays with the visual balance of positive and negative spaces in order to achieve a particular aesthetic. Most importantly though, it is used to increase readability, breathability, and structural rhythm.</p>
<p>A classic offence that plagues many designers and non-designers alike is the overabundance of elements in a design. While making use of all available space might reduce canvas size and scroll distance, it does more harm than good when it comes to a viewer’s understanding of information. Overcrowding will render a design impenetrable. The white space allows users to consider one thing at a time. That creates calm and that creates good user-experience.</p>
<p>With that said, I like to think of white space beyond digital and print. It applies to our physical environment too. In fact, it applies to a ton of things in life—from how we speak, write, draw, meditate, or exercise. A better term for this might be what the Japanese call ‘<a href="https://new.uniquejapan.com/ikebana/ma/" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">ma</a>’. It’s a concept that can be described as an emptiness of space, a gap, or even silence. In its architectural context, ‘ma’ refers to the dimension of space between the structural posts of an interior. The layout is intentionally designed to encompass empty space. A perfect example of this would be a traditional Japanese tea room. No ornamentation, pure minimalism—creating a sensory space.</p>
<p>If we think about an environment in which we can control—like our homes—we can use ‘ma’ to help us identify what we value and what we don’t. What we need to use, enjoy to use and look at, and what we don’t.</p>
<p>If ever there was a good time to consider our use of white space in our lives, it's probably now.</p>]]></description>

            <title>Minimalism, Marketing, and Digital Sales</title>
            <link>https://carlbarenbrug.com/@/page/RkFOSFkV2BRaXJ75</link>
            <guid isPermaLink="false">blog/minimalism-marketing-digital-sales</guid>
            <pubDate>Sat, 07 Dec 2020 00:00:00 +0100</pubDate>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>A while ago I published a couple of articles on <a href="https://cmhb.de/selling-digital" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">selling digital</a> products and <a href="https://cmhb.de/monetising-minimalism" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">monetising minimalism</a>. Over the past 12 months I have been working extensively in making and marketing digital products in various forms and on various platforms. In the aforementioned articles, I’ve talked about the comparable simplicity of selling digital products over physical ones from a logistics perspective. It also reduces the physical clutter that people can accumulate. There’s absolutely no doubt in my mind that my focus on digital creation is the right way forward, but it’s definitely not without its challenges. So let’s look at the types of products I’m talking about and break down my experience with them so far.</p>
<h2>Digital Magazines</h2>
<p><a href="https://minimalissimo.com" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Minimalissimo</a> has produced three printed magazines to date—all of which were small print runs. It wasn’t my intention initially to sell these as digital versions once they had sold out, but given that I received many emails asking about their availability, I thought it made sense from a business perspective to make them available for a reduced price. Although the sales numbers are still barely into the hundreds, it makes total sense to keep these beautiful and well-written magazines available to be read. Especially given the hard work in making them is already done.</p>
<p>I don’t think I will ever go down the path of going straight to digital for the Minimalissimo magazines, because there’s something still very special about the tactile experience of a high-quality mag. I love having all three printed editions sitting proudly in my home to occasionally browse. With that said, for future editions, I might look at even smaller print runs.</p>
<h2>Subscription Services</h2>
<p>For over 12 months I have been using <a href="https://substack.com" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Substack</a>—a premium email subscription service. I’ve used this specifically for <a href="https://minimalism.life" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Minimalism Life</a> where we publish exclusive weekly essays on simple living written by a small team of writers. It’s a massive challenge to convince people to continually support writing on the web because so much material on topics such as minimalism, is already freely available.</p>
<p>The tool for this subscription service works well, although I do think Substack setting the minimum monthly payment of $5 is too high. Regardless, the challenge lies in the marketing side of things—not the digital creations. Marketing is not something I’m particularly good at, but it is something that I appreciate is important if a business is dependent on sales or monetary support. I am learning more about this everyday. I must take a people-first approach to the projects I am involved in. And for Minimalism Life, that is putting our writers at the forefront and engaging much more with our community and readership.</p>
<h2>Website Templates</h2>
<p>Another avenue of digital sales I’ve ventured down, albeit in a far more passive manner, is website templates. Specifically, templates designed for <a href="https://getkirby.com" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Kirby</a>—a flexible and lightweight file-based CMS. <a href="https://manuelmoreale.com" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Manu</a> and I have put together a couple of templates to make available in the Minimalissimo shop, which has seen some success, but as Kirby is far less known than the likes of WordPress, we are targeting a very small but growing market. We will continue making these for a couple of reasons: we love making sites, and we want to encourage people to use Kirby because it’s an incredible product with an awesome community. So expect more or improved templates in the near future.</p>
<h2>Donations/Support</h2>
<p>This is the newest avenue I am going to experiment with and I’m still weighing up the best tool to use. Although I may not market this as “donations” and is certainly not “sales”, I do think it can be used in an effective way. With <a href="https://minimalissimo.com" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Minimalissimo</a> in mind for this, I want readers to monetarily support the site without the need to buy a product from the <a href="https://minimalissimo.shop" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">shop</a>. Readers will have the opportunity to make a single donation as a gesture of support, or they can choose to make a recurring donation and become a member of Minimalissimo’s community. Members will receive a small number of rewards as a way of appreciation for their support. Membership is not a subscription service, and can be terminated by the reader at any time. Donations can be made anonymously, individually, or on behalf of a business. To me, this makes so much sense and takes a side-step away from other design-related sites out there, who shamelessly plaster their front-end with ads and questionable tracking cookies.</p>
<p>I hope it works and I hope it’s something you can get behind, because I don’t think anybody wants to see more advertising on the web.</p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>Throughout 2019 I was using Android, which was an interesting experiment. Using the minimalist launcher by <a href="https://www.blloc.com" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Blloc</a>, it really made me aware of my phone usage and encouraged me to reduce not just my screen time, but also the number of apps I installed in the first place. This year however, I have moved back to iOS, currently using the iPhone 11. The phone itself is good, and the camera is fantastic, but I am certainly looking forward to the next iPhone hardware design, which I believe will be more closely aligned with the iPad Pro. A big step up in form factor.</p>
<p>In terms of my phone setup, I have tried to maintain my behaviour and mindset that I had during my experience with Blloc and apply it to the iPhone. I can’t say I have done so to the same extent, but I do average 2 hours in screen time per day. Not great, but not bad either given the nature of what I do.</p>
<p>So let’s break down the setup:</p>
<h2>Lock Screen</h2>
<p>An exclusive series of wallpapers for Minimalissimo shot by <a href="https://www.instagram.com/_andresjasso/" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Andres Jasso</a>. This, along with a small library of others will be available soon for download on the <a href="https://minimalissimo.shop" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Minimalissimo shop</a>.</p>
<div style="margin-bottom: 4rem"><figure class="img-figure"><div class="img-wrapper" data-tooltip="Phone Setup on iPhone 11" style="padding-bottom: 150%"><img alt="Phone Setup on iPhone 11" class="img" loading="lazy" src="https://carlbarenbrug.com/media/pages/blog/phone-setup-2020/e729903bb6-1690029228/phone-setup-20-wall.jpg"></div></figure></div>
<h2>Home Screen</h2>
<p>I currently have 31 apps in total (including system apps), which all fit on a single home screen, but I do admit that I have grouped a few apps (which is cheating a little). These are:</p>
<h3>Productivity</h3>
<ul>
<li>iA Writer</li>
<li>Slack</li>
<li>Dropbox</li>
<li>Dropbox Paper</li>
<li>Safari</li>
<li>Mail</li>
<li>Clear</li>
</ul>
<h3>Entertainment</h3>
<ul>
<li><del>Twitter</del></li>
<li>Instagram</li>
<li>Amazon Music</li>
<li>Memrise</li>
</ul>
<h3>Basic Tools</h3>
<ul>
<li>Calendar</li>
<li>Weather</li>
<li>RBS</li>
<li>PayPal</li>
<li>Phone</li>
<li>Maps</li>
<li>WhatsApp</li>
<li>Messages</li>
<li>Camera</li>
<li>Clock</li>
<li>Uber</li>
<li>WMU (Nikon)</li>
<li>Calculator</li>
<li>FaceTime</li>
</ul>
<h3>System</h3>
<ul>
<li>Photos</li>
<li>Contacts</li>
<li>Find My Phone</li>
<li>App Store</li>
<li>Wallet</li>
<li>Settings</li>
</ul>
<figure class="img-figure"><div class="img-wrapper" data-tooltip="Phone Setup on iPhone 11" style="padding-bottom: 150%"><img alt="Phone Setup on iPhone 11" class="img" loading="lazy" src="https://carlbarenbrug.com/media/pages/blog/phone-setup-2020/f13303c74c-1690029227/phone-setup-20.jpg"></div></figure>
<p>It is worth noting that I do occasionally download other apps if I need to use them only for a short time, but if I no longer need them, I delete them from my phone. All of the above are apps I use on a regular or semi-regular basis, with exception to Find My Phone—I’m not that careless. I <del>am tempted to remove</del> have since removed Twitter  because I can easily access this from my desktop.</p>
<p>How does your setup compare? Are there any apps I should be considering? Any tips you want to share? Always happy to hear from you.</p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>Allowing readers or fans of your work to financially support you is nothing new. It allows people to become active participants in the work you create and that they value. The most popular platform for this sort of thing is Patreon. A creator gives people access to exclusive content, community, and insight into the creative process. In exchange, creators get the freedom to do their best work, and the stability they need to build an independent creative career. It’s a great business model, because it creates a much stronger connection to your audience. It also limits or entirely removes the need for advertisements.</p>
<p>For individual creators, this movement has been a blessing, and it’s allowed many people to focus entirely on their craft. It’s perhaps less known, or even expected, for studios or brands to do this, but it is something that continues to grow.</p>
<p>Well, I have now moved into that realm of support, specifically for <a href="https://minimalissimo.com" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Minimalissimo</a> by creating a membership programme. I like to consider Minimalissimo a little bit different to other design-focused sites and magazines out there. We’re not just dedicated to the niche market of minimalism, but we also do things differently when it comes to advertising. I don’t think anybody appreciates obtrusive ads being plastered all over the place when all you’re trying to do is read a web page. We have never done that and we never will. Your reading experience is what’s really important.</p>
<p>With that in mind, I am experimenting with a model that centres around support and kindness, rather than advertising.</p>
<p>I am not looking to create a subscription service, but I am open to publishing exclusive content. This membership, as fun as it will be to work on, will not become the new focus of what Minimalissimo is. The focus remains on the material we publish daily for <em>everyone</em> to consume.</p>
<p>I am also doing this because I really want to build a better and more direct relationship with our readers. I want to continue to improve the reading and visual experience, and determine what areas are most valued. I also want to build a small community of people whom I can speak with when I’m looking to experiment with an idea. To gain feedback and explore new ideas together.</p>
<p>Instead of using Patreon, we decided to build our own members area on <a href="https://minimalissimo.com" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">minimalissimo.com</a>. Support is managed through <a href="https://donorbox.org" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">donorbox.org</a> by means of an embedded widget. It’s a very simple setup and I think it works better than sending people off to an entirely different platform.</p>
<p>I hope this is something you like, and I hope you will consider graciously supporting what we do at Minimalissimo. It will be greatly appreciated.</p>

            <title>Web Design and Carbon Impact</title>
            <link>https://carlbarenbrug.com/@/page/CbAZfwEowaG5O2nh</link>
            <guid isPermaLink="false">blog/web-design-and-carbon-impact</guid>
            <pubDate>Sat, 07 Dec 2020 00:00:00 +0100</pubDate>
            <description><![CDATA[<blockquote>
<p>How can we, as web professionals, help to make the web more energy efficient?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>From data centres to transmission networks to the devices that we hold in our hands, it is all consuming electricity, and in turn producing carbon emissions. According to recent estimates, the entire network already consumes 10% of global electricity production, with data traffic doubling roughly every two years. It’s probably something very few people think about, or are even aware of as being an issue. But the fact of the matter is that the Internet consumes a huge amount of electricity. And when it comes to web design, there is a lot that can be done to make the web far more energy efficient.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Attitudes</h2>
<p>Creating a website is a lot more accessible today, made simpler by the emergence of no-code site builders. But it might be asking a lot for your typical web user or amateur creator to be aware of the environmental impact of their site. This, however, shouldn’t really be the case for any digital professional. Naturally, web developers will be more conscious of the weight of their pages, given that they are fully immersed in the code and content management that serves what you see on a web page. But even then, many developers simply look for the quickest route to completing a project, rather than the best way to produce the quickest and most efficient site. </p>
<p>So they load a website with bulky Javascript and third-party tools to meet the visual specification of the client or designer. As long as it works, right? They probably don’t care. They’re probably happy with their site that loads quickly on their 500Mbps connection. Who cares if they’re wasting expensive data on mobile connections in other countries? “But Carl, some of us don’t have the luxury of building super high-performance, lightweight, and optimised sites due to client budgets and deadlines.” Well, I think you need to work on your craft, change your attitude and your priorities, or find another profession.</p>
<p>When we talk about the energy efficiency of websites, it’s easy to assume that it’s a purely technical topic. However, efficiency can be improved before we even build a website. Design and content have a big impact on energy efficiency.</p>
<p>Therefore, some of the biggest contributors to heavy sites and large CO2 emissions, are <em>designers</em>. Large moving imagery, multiple web fonts, animation, sound, autoplaying video, and generally esoteric design is prevalent these days. We see showcase after showcase of the <em>best of the web</em>, where the only criteria is: “Does it look well-designed?” Well, look under the hood. It’s pretty terrifying. And that’s not even getting into the many accessibility concerns. If only more designers would ask themselves, “When was the last time I considered page size when designing something? When was the last time I decided that page weight was more important than aesthetics?” </p>
<p>These are questions I have put to designers before, and the response quite often is, “I’m just experimenting with technologies and trying to improve my UI skills. What harm is there in that?” Well, <em>Site of the Day</em>, the harm is your energy usage, and the likelihood that nobody—besides an echo chamber of fellow designers—give a shit about your over-design. People just want to access content quickly, without distraction, without friction, and without it using a tonne of data. That’s not to say aesthetics aren’t important—they certainly are. The visual design of a site can play a significant role in user experience, readability, and conversion, but as with most things, there is a balance to be achieved. And there is a responsibility to be shared.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Solutions</h2>
<p>Fortunately, there are a growing number of web professionals who do care about the impact sites have on the planet, and there are many solutions designers and developers alike can find to improve their sites without overly compromising their designs. Solutions that I am actively looking into to improve my own work.</p>
<p>So how can we be more energy efficient in web design? Well, the folks over at <a href="https://www.wholegraindigital.com/blog/website-energy-efficiency/" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Wholegrain Digital</a> put together a comprehensive list, but here are some key considerations:</p>
<h3>Reduce Images</h3>
<p>The single largest contributors to page weight. The more images, the more data needs to be transferred and the more energy is used. A good starting point is to ask oneself:</p>
<ul>
<li>Does the image genuinely add value to the user?</li>
<li>Does it communicate useful information?</li>
<li>Could the same impact be achieved if the image was smaller?</li>
<li>Could we achieve the same effect with a vector graphic (or even CSS style) instead of a photo?</li>
</ul>
<h3>Optimise Images</h3>
<p>Some designs are focused almost entirely on imagery, in which case optimisation is vital to better performance. There are technical decisions that significantly affect the file size of images displayed on a page. These include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Load images at the correct scale instead of relying on CSS to resize them, so that you avoid loading images that are larger than the scale they will be displayed at.</li>
<li>Use image optimisation tools before you upload them to your site. I personally use <a href="https://imageoptim.com/mac" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">ImageOptim</a>.</li>
<li>Use the most efficient file format for each image, such as WebP instead of JPEG (although this is not supported by all browsers).</li>
<li>Use image processing tools to resize, crop, and enhance your images that are served. I use <a href="https://www.imgix.com" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">imgimx</a> for this, which works well for image-heavy sites such as <a href="https://minimalissimo.com" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Minimalissimo</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Reduce Video</h3>
<p>By far the most data intensive and processing intensive form of content. As with images, ask yourself if videos are really necessary. If they are, never autoplay a video. It creates a much higher load on the users CPU, resulting in vastly greater energy consumption. Plus, it’s annoying as hell. Let the user decide whether or not to play a video.</p>
<h3>Font Selection and Optimisation</h3>
<p>Web fonts can enhance the visual appeal of site designs, as well as improve readability, but they can add significant file weight to the sites on which they are used. A single font file could be as much as 250Kb, and that might only be for the standard weight. If you want bold, add another 250Kb! A couple of options worth considering:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use system fonts where possible.</li>
<li>Use fewer font variations.</li>
<li>Stick to modern web font file formats like WOFF and WOFF2.</li>
<li>Subset fonts to only include the characters needed on the site.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Write Clean Code</h3>
<p>Tidy and streamlined code is a fundamentally good thing. Keep code clean and simple, avoid duplication, and write efficient queries. The code behind the scenes should be a well oiled, lean machine. And I’ll take this opportunity to share a controversial opinion: <em>all designers should learn to code.</em> At least if they want a website. No-code site builders can be very good, but if you’re not aware of the underlying code, then you’ll be less aware of ways to optimise your site.</p>
<h3>Use Less Javascript</h3>
<p>JS impacts website efficiency in two ways: by adding file weight to the web page and by increasing the amount of processing required by the user’s device. The second of these is something that applies to JS much more than to other types of files. Look for ways to achieve front-end interactions, functionality, and animations using more efficient technologies like CSS, or at least use JS efficiently. A particular mention should be given here to tracking and advertising scripts that rarely offer any value to the user, but can add significant file weight. Don’t let advertising get in the way of craftsmanship.</p>
<h3>Use Server Caching</h3>
<p>Using caching technologies such as <a href="https://memcached.org" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Memcached</a> or <a href="https://varnish-cache.org" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Varnish</a> pre-generate static versions of each page so that the server overhead can be significantly reduced for most visitors. This significantly reduces server energy consumption and makes a big difference to page load times. </p>
<h3>SEO</h3>
<p>When optimising a site for search engines, we are helping people find the information they want quickly and easily. When SEO is successful, it results in people spending less time browsing the web looking for information, and visiting fewer pages that don’t meet their needs.</p>
<hr />
<p>No site is perfect, but appreciating that we have a responsibility to produce better digital design for the planet and for users is a good place to start. Web efficiency is an attitude and the result of a mindful approach to building for the web.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>I recently read an interesting article by <a href="https://medium.com/better-humans/live-like-a-hydra-c02337782a89" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Buster Benson</a> that touches on the notion of “modes”.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Everything in the universe goes through cycles. Cycles of high energy and low energy. Cycles of change and stability. Cycles of focus and distraction. We’re no different, but most of the time we are trying to force fit ourselves into a mode that we aren’t in, and that causes trouble.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Buster outlined modes (or states) that he encounters from day-to-day throughout his life. Modes realised through self-awareness that become a method of changing things when feeling stuck. And it got me thinking about some of the various modes I feel I enter into in life as well. So I also created a similar list.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Self Mode</h2>
<p>A state of introspection. A way to reconnect with myself and understand what my needs are and what I can do to meet them. It’s also a way to revisit values, beliefs, and short/long-term goals. For me, this will include getting quality sleep, good nutrition, light exercise like yoga and cycling, practising meditation, and generally a healthy spell of solitude.</p>
<h2>Slow Mode</h2>
<p>This is all about slow living. Slowing down and leaving the chaos to one side. It’s a time to forget about work commitments, calendars, people, and politics. It’s a time where I like to enjoy the simple things in life. Making coffee, tidying my home, watching Netflix, spending time with my cats, going for walks, or capturing photos. It’s about being present in the moment and taking the pressure off everything.</p>
<h2>Work Mode</h2>
<p>One of two focus states. Where focus goes, energy flows. This is about fixing things, cleaning things, maintaining things, organising things, and planning things. It’s also a mode when I need to focus on learning, researching, reading, writing, designing, and editing. Hell, even using social media. This is not a state I can sustain for long periods though; it’s just not in me and I’m OK with that. This is the productivity mode that is measured by action, not by time.</p>
<h2>Training Mode</h2>
<p>The second focus state. This is when I need to balance mental and physical strength without distraction. Investing time and effort into things I find important for my personal growth. Whether climbing or weight training, I like to push my body and mind (some days more than others). Overcoming uncertainties, fears, doubts, challenges, and fatigue. Playing the long game to enjoy the fun things in life and better understand my mind and body along the way.</p>
<h2>Recovery Mode</h2>
<p>Not dissimilar to Self and Slow Mode. This is about identifying what the mind and body needs in order to feel better. We never know what is around the corner and we never know how hard it will hit us. Like a global pandemic. And sometimes we simply need to reset. So we need time and space to recover. For me, this is about taking a simple approach and focusing on the basics: quality sleep (not just at night, but even a <em>siesta</em> through the day), plenty of water, eating well,  switching off from technology, reading a (non-educational) book, and exploring nature. It might even include going on a well-being retreat of some kind (not that I have ever done that, but I’m open to it). It might be opening up to a friend or a stranger to release an emotional burden. Whatever it is you need to recover from, be patient and allow yourself to rebuild and regain control.</p>
<h2>People Mode</h2>
<p>I wouldn’t say I am a “people person”. I would consider myself an introvert. With that said however, spending quality time with certain people can be extremely rewarding. This is a mode I switch to when I find it’s important to focus on others. Whether it’s with my partner, my family, or a few close friends. It might even be as simple as sharing things people have done to celebrate and support good things they are doing in this world. It’s about making better connections, not taking people for granted, and remembering just how short life is.</p>
<hr />
<p>Writing these, I realise that I experience different modes multiple times a day, but I can also take a step back and reflect on what mode I was in from a general perspective; be it over the course of a week, a month, or even a year. It’s an interesting exercise in self-care and being aware that you can intentionally switch modes. Sometimes though, you have to be patient with yourself. Don’t force it.</p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>In recent months, you might have found yourself with an abundance of time that has come to you unexpectedly. Time saved by working from home instead of commuting. A pared down social life instead of filling up your calendar with events. Fewer commitments. Less chaos. But how are you spending all this saved time? With all this time you have back, as temporary as it may be, will you choose to spend it on things that are truly important to you?</p>
<p>There’s no correct way to spend your time. Or more specifically—free time. You might choose to read, write, exercise, explore nature, volunteer, watch TV, listen to music,  listen to podcasts, learn about topics that interest you, cook, clean, repair things, build things, or maybe you choose to slow down and simply do nothing.</p>
<p>The most important thing to do with any time that you’ve managed to regain is to ask yourself how you’re spending it and how you want to spend it in the future. Wasted time is time that passes you mindlessly. Saved time is an opportunity to use your time with purpose.</p>]]></description>

            <title>A Book on Minimalism and Simple Living</title>
            <link>https://carlbarenbrug.com/@/page/Nm2lv6JozGf9qWe0</link>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>Over the past three months or so I have been working on creating an ebook (and perhaps a printed edition to boot) for <a href="https://minimalism.life" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Minimalism Life</a>—a side project I cofounded back in 2016. Well, it has now been completed and published, and is available for download. <em>Inside Minimalism Vol.1</em> is a collection of 50 short and relatable essays on simple living by a small team of writers from different backgrounds, but who all share a deep appreciation for minimalism as a way of life, albeit to varying degrees. Supported by their own personal experiences, these writers want to inspire and encourage others to clear the path of life’s stuff, so they can get to where they really want to be.</p>
<p>This ebook discusses minimalism as a tool and covers many topics such as slow and quiet living, curation, consumerism, and family. It is not a strict guide book or a rule book. Rather, it is a book we hope will inspire, motivate, and encourage you to take a slow and simplified approach to life through lived experiences. As the writers vary, the tone of voice varies with it, so there is a really interesting mix of writing styles and ways of thinking. Some essays will be exactly what you needed to read, others will be irrelevant to you, but all these essays are simple and enjoyable.</p>
<p>Special thanks to <a href="https://ivanmoreale.com" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Ivan Moreale</a> for the beautiful cover design and formatting.</p>

<p><em>Inside Minimalism</em> originated as a subscription service we launched on <a href="https://minimalism.life" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">minimalism.life</a> a year ago. The subscription includes a new essay to your inbox every week. Although we continue to run this as our primary product, we recognised not everyone wants to commit to a subscription, so we decided to make these essays more accessible. This is how the book was born. You can enjoy a curated collection of beautiful writing with a single one-off purchase and still support independent creators without committing to anything.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>I have never been a particularly big reader. I enjoy books and I enjoy reading blog posts, but I seem to make more room for the latter, even though I enjoy reading novels far more than I do blogs. The reason is simple enough: I spend the vast majority of my day behind a computer screen for work, side projects, writing, editing, and entertainment. And when I am away from the screen I focus on my physical health, or spending time with people, or resting. OK, enough of the excuses. What I want to talk about is the beauty of focused reading. Or better yet, completely undistracted reading.</p>
<p>How we read is highly variable, whether it is print books, ebooks, blogs, newspapers, magazines, emails, newsletters, news articles, forums, or social media posts. And how distracting each of these forms can also vary massively. It is often a far from focused reading experience, let alone a pleasurable one. How do you read without distractions? Most of these reading forms pulls us away from the others with alerts and updates coming in frequently, vying for our attention.</p>
<p>One of the main reasons I enjoy reading books more than I do most of the aforementioned forms, is because 99% of books are entirely focused on the written word. There is also no danger of receiving notifications if you’re reading a print book or Kindle ebook. Leave your tech behind, find a comfortable spot, and enjoy a read in silence. It can be a fully immersive experience and that is what a lot of authors aim to achieve.</p>
<p>When it comes to reading blogs, I am always happy when I find ones that are focused entirely on the reading experience. No sidebars, no ads, no pop-ups, no need to install additional browser extensions. With that said, I think it is a good idea to install apps like <a href="https://nextdns.io" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">NextDNS</a> and <a href="https://1blocker.com" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">1Blocker</a>—it results in a much quicker and cleaner browsing experience overall. A few fine examples of sites that focus on your reading experience are:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://ia.net/design/blog" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">ia.net/design/blog</a></li>
<li><a href="https://manuelmoreale.com" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">manuelmoreale.com</a></li>
<li><a href="https://electricgecko.de" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">electricgecko.de</a></li>
<li><a href="https://mnmlist.com" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">mnmlist.com</a></li>
<li><a href="https://minimalissimo.com" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">minimalissimo.com</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Visually noisy sites are largely the reason RSS readers are still widely used, which strip away the design and leave the absolute essentials, sometimes offering a better aesthetic too. But even browsers such as Safari have inbuilt Reader options that work in a similar fashion.</p>
<p>I think the same focused reading approach can be taken with newsletters depending on the topic. If a newsletter is delivered in plain text, even better. Keep it as light as you can if you are sending them. How you receive mail will largely depend on your mail client, but unfortunately there is not a huge amount you can do to control the consistency of how you read emails.</p>
<p>As for reading social media, whether it be Twitter, Facebook, or Instagram, opening these sites for short periods at scheduled times of the day means you avoid getting lost in the noise and distracting you from more important or enjoyable reading. A quick scan and light engagement will usually suffice. It is how I have been using social media for the past six months and it is a much better reading experience for me. Or you can just forget social media entirely.</p>]]></description>

            <title>Building a Membership</title>
            <link>https://carlbarenbrug.com/@/page/7yKQgNyHNlkpOkBR</link>
            <guid isPermaLink="false">blog/building-a-membership</guid>
            <pubDate>Sat, 07 Dec 2020 00:00:00 +0100</pubDate>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>In late spring of 2020, <a href="https://minimalissimo.com" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Minimalissimo</a> introduced a <a href="https://minimalissimo.com/membership" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">membership</a> platform as a means to generate passive income for greater sustainability, engage more with our community, design things members can use, discover how advertisement-free reading is valued, and determine to what extent creators we feature value our magazine as a promotional tool for their work.</p>
<p>From Day 1 of this membership, I viewed it as an experiment with low expectation. Given the simplicity of the membership signup process (a brainchild of <a href="https://manuelmoreale.com" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Manu</a>) and how effortlessly and unobtrusively we introduced the concept throughout the website, I thought it would appeal to a small proportion of readers, ignored by some, and overlooked by others. Gradually however, the membership has grown, but it is at a snail’s pace and the numbers are modest. Sure, some people simply signup for the perks and then cease their support once they have what they want (I have no time for those people), and others support us without even a consideration of the perks (I love those people). Then we have members who support us and also enjoy all the perks we offer (I also love those people).</p>
<p>Site visits to <a href="https://minimalissimo.com" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">minimalissimo.com</a> fluctuate throughout the year but we still hit +50k per month, so this can give me a rough idea of how many readers (as well as social media followers) might become members. To be honest though, I couldn't care less about web analytics. They are becoming increasingly unreliable through the introduction of private browsers and extensions (fuck cookies). Same goes for social media followers, where people barely see any of the content we publish due to those wonderful algorithms we all love to complain about.</p>
<p>With modest membership numbers, but positive reactions, I am going to persevere with this model for the foreseeable future. I have also set a tentative goal to reach 100 core members. That will cover almost all of our overheads to keep the site running smoothly and consistently. Whether we reach that in two months or twelve, I don’t really mind, because we will continue to experiment with this platform and how else to introduce it to our community of readers.</p>
<p>I live with the hope and intention that eventually donations from our members will form the core income stream for Minimalissimo, and our <a href="https://minimalissimo.shop" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">online shop</a> will be supplementary to that. That will obviously need to far exceed 100 members, but I don’t think it is an insurmountable challenge.</p>
<p>You can read more about the <a href="https://minimalissimo.com/articles/minimalissimo-membership" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">rationale</a> behind the Minimalissimo membership and if you are interested in <a href="https://minimalissimo.com/membership" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">becoming a member</a> yourself, then I would greatly appreciate and welcome your support.</p>
<p>And if you are curious about what the perks are, you get:</p>
<ul>
<li>Digital magazine bundle</li>
<li>Wallpapers library</li>
<li>Members email list to discuss plans, ideas, and experiments</li>
<li>Select product discounts</li>
</ul>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>Here we go again. New design. New structure. Better design. Better structure. Better use of typography. Better readability. Better user-experience. Clearer focus. This is <a href="https://minimalism.life" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">minimalism.life</a> version 3. The updated design applies the principle of minimalism in its truest sense (or at least pretty close to it). Not only has the site been built (by <a href="https://manuelmoreale.com" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Manu</a>) with an ultra-light back-end powered by <a href="https://getkirby.com" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Kirby</a>, but the front-end has been pared back to focus a lot more on the text and a lot less on imagery. We haven’t entirely removed the use of imagery, but when used, these are functional images, not decorative—meaning they are used to apply context and clarity.</p>
<figure class="img-figure"><div class="img-wrapper" data-tooltip="Minimalism Life V3" style="padding-bottom: 80%"><img alt="Minimalism Life V3" class="img" loading="lazy" src="https://carlbarenbrug.com/media/pages/blog/minimalism-life-v3/165a1bafc3-1690029229/minimalismlifev3.jpg"></div></figure>
<p>The design is typography-led, making better use of the beautiful <a href="https://typetype.org/fonts/tt-commons/" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">TT Commons</a> typeface. Although we do apply various sizes and weights throughout the site, there is only one font-family—also applied to the Minimalism Life word mark.</p>
<p>The information architecture of the site hasn’t drastically changed from the previous version, but we have altered a few elements, including the introduction of a dedicated Book page, driven by the recent publication of <em><a href="https://minimalism.life/book" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Inside Minimalism Vol.1</a></em>. We have also greatly improved the messaging for our subscription service centred around our collaborative series of weekly essays. And we included a new Questions page, which asks our community a single question per month, inviting you to get in touch with your thoughts, which we aim to round up and share at the end of each month in a dedicated journal article.</p>
<p>With every new version of ML, the underlying concept of the site becomes clearer. We want to communicate that it is a collaborative project driven by a community of those who appreciate and practice minimalism and simple living through various aspects of their lives. I hope with this in mind, the site continues to grow and we continue to offer value to our readers. I don’t know if I can contribute much more than I have done over these four years, but I am optimistic about the project’s future.</p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>Over the course of 2020, I have been making efforts to create a Minimalissimo LAB. “<a href="https://youtu.be/Qw9oX-kZ_9k" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Whatcha talkin&lsquo; bout, Willis?</a>” What I mean by a LAB is a virtual environment that encapsulates all that Minimalissimo makes, curates, and publishes. It’s more a way to organise everything we do and ideas we brew, rather than a physical environment like a workshop. It’s an idea inspired by the folks over at LOT. I love the way they approach creativity and community. So I have looked to evolve this little minimalist house into more than a curation of design inspiration. Primarily to discover how far I can take the company and to keep things interesting for myself. The LAB essentially consists of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://minimalissimo.com" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Online Publication</a></li>
<li><a href="https://minimalissimo.shop" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Online Shop</a></li>
<li><a href="https://minimalissimo.com/membership" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Membership</a></li>
<li><a href="https://minimalissimo.com/newsletter-signup" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Newsletter</a></li>
<li><a href="https://minimalissimo.shop/product/minimalissimo-no3-digital" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">In-house Design</a></li>
<li><a href="https://minimalissimo.shop/product/slm-613" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Collaborations</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Some of these channels help feed the others. For instance, many of our collaborations and in-house designs feed what is available in the shop. These are usually unique products we have made and can be both physical and digital works. Then we have our online publication—the core of Minimalissimo. This feeds into our newsletter and membership. So all of these elements talk to each other to create what Minimalissimo is today—a digital (and occasionally print) publication, a shop, and a creative studio. Collectively and internally speaking, this is the LAB. And this is what my focus will be in 2021. Designing more, making more, selling more, curating well, and growing a community, albeit a small one. And I hope you will consider <a href="https://minimalissimo.com/membership" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">joining as a member</a> if you haven’t already. I greatly appreciate the support. Large and small.</p>]]></description>

            <title>The Beauty of 3D Printing</title>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>3D printing is a process that creates a three-dimensional object by building successive layers of raw material. When you think about 3D printing, you might think about plastic models that feel more like a novelty than anything of real quality and value. That might have been the case 20 years ago, but 3D printing has evolved substantially in recent years and we’re now seeing world-changing work in this field. Not just in an environmental sense through eco-materials and manufacturing, but in a human sense, where 3D printing is changing the lives of people in remarkable ways, such as in the housing and medical industries, especially off the back of the Covid-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>One of the best examples of this is <a href="https://newstorycharity.org/3d-community/" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">New Story</a>—a nonprofit organisation that seeks to end global homelessness by making 3D printed homes. I came across their work on an episode of <em>Home</em> on Apple TV. As a collaborative project between New Story and construction technologies company, ICON, they use proprietary 3D printing robotics, software, and advanced materials, solving a number of problems in the contemporary building industry with their breakthrough technologies. They have embarked to build a community where families in need will receive safe homes in a very short space of time. It’s eye-opening and an incredible way to tackle the increasingly urgent situation around homelessness.</p>
<p>Besides this, there’s some really interesting 3D printing being made for medical supplies like surgical instruments, dental restorations, and external prosthetics. We also see this process heavily applied in the likes of Formula 1, where small changes to parts happen constantly and the need for rapid prototyping is vital. You see, the flexibility and versatility of 3D printing allows designers and engineers to make changes easily without the need to set up additional equipment or tools. It’s not just a massive time-saver, but also hugely cost effective.</p>
<p>Circling back to Covid briefly, over the past year more than 1,700 3D printing specialists offered to 3D print masks, respirators, valves, and other medical tools. The convenience of on-demand manufacturing in such a global crisis has brought the necessity and importance of 3D printing to new levels.</p>
<p>With that said, what I find most interesting about 3D printing these days is that it is far more accessible to the general public than ever before. The continual reduced cost of owning a Fused Deposition Modelling (FDM) 3D printer and the fact you only really need digital model files to then find a local printer manufacturer and have a product made there and then, is very cool. Although I have no plans to own a 3D printer myself yet, I am really interested to explore the 3D model market, designing products that can be downloaded, customised, and produced at your convenience. Imagine designing and printing most of your home furnishings in a variety of eco-materials, colours, and sizes. Design that is tailor-made for your home. Or if you are planning to travel around the world (not this year obviously) and settle down in a totally different place, you can just take your model design with you and print it when you arrive.</p>
<p>I’ll continue to explore this space, possibly making models available in the <a href="https://minimalissimo.shop" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Minimalissimo shop</a>, and hopefully get the opportunity to print something this year, just as an experiment.</p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>I shared my workspace setup <a href="https://carlbarenbrug.com/workspace">last year</a>, but since then, I have changed a few things, so I felt it’s probably time to share an update on my current setup for both hardware and software. Given the continued Covid restrictions here in sunny Scotland, I am now working from home full-time, so it’s super important to try to create a decent space to work within and to avoid my sanity from falling into a sink hole of despair. I’m just about managing to do that.</p>
<hr />
<h2>The Physical Desk</h2>
<figure class="img-figure"><div class="img-wrapper" data-tooltip="Minimal Workspace Setup by Carl Barenbrug" style="padding-bottom: 150%"><img alt="Minimal Workspace Setup by Carl Barenbrug" class="img" loading="lazy" src="https://carlbarenbrug.com/media/pages/blog/workspace-revisited/609f9b9136-1690029230/workspace.jpg"></div></figure>
<p>My office space is, as you might expect, pretty sparse, except for a pesky wire or two. Will we ever see the end of visible wires? Unless power is more seamlessly integrated in our furniture and walls, the answer is probably, no. The desk is my favourite thing about this workspace. It’s called the Sinus Trestle by L&amp;Z. Although I am increasingly feeling the need to invest in a standing desk. I think my body needs that, but unfortunately, almost all standing desks look like shit. So here’s the rest of the hardware setup:</p>
<ul>
<li>Samsung 27" Space Monitor</li>
<li>Apple MacBook Air (late 2020 with M1 chip)</li>
<li>Oliver Bonas lamp</li>
<li>L&amp;Z paper tray</li>
<li>HAY’s About a Chair (designed by Hee Welling)</li>
<li>Apple AirPods (2nd gen)</li>
<li>MUJI notebook</li>
<li>MUJI sketching pen</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>The Virtual Desk</h2>
<figure class="img-figure"><div class="img-wrapper" data-tooltip="Minimal Desktop by Carl Barenbrug" style="padding-bottom: 66.666666666667%"><img alt="Minimal Desktop by Carl Barenbrug" class="img" loading="lazy" src="https://carlbarenbrug.com/media/pages/blog/workspace-revisited/9f379cc329-1690029230/workspace-sw.jpg"></div></figure>
<p>For my desktop, I keep it obsessively clean. My app dock is always hidden by default and only pops up on mouse hover. This not only helps me focus on the app in use, limiting distraction, but it also allows me to appreciate the desktop artwork so much more. As for my wallpaper, I rotate between different designs in the <a href="https://minimalissimo.shop/product/slm-613-desktop" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">SLM 613</a> set I made in collaboration with <a href="https://www.studiolenzing.com" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Studio Lenzing</a>. My main software tools are:</p>
<h3>Everyday</h3>
<ul>
<li>Safari (browser)</li>
<li>iA Writer (articles, notes)</li>
<li>Dropbox (file storage)</li>
<li>Dropbox Paper (documentation)</li>
<li>Tempo (email)</li>
<li>Visual Studio Code (coding)</li>
<li>Transmit (ftp client)</li>
<li>Photoshop (image editing)</li>
<li>ImageOptim (image optimisation)</li>

<h2>Wishlist</h2>
<ul>
<li>Standing desk</li>
<li>Vitsœ 606 shelving system</li>
<li><del>Microsoft Surface 2 Headphones</del></li>

            <title>A Quality Return to Print</title>
            <link>https://carlbarenbrug.com/@/page/RGBM86wdWM8iJWd6</link>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>“Print is dead!” So they say. I think I have probably said this as well to be honest. And maybe it is true. Digital design and digital consumption is on an inevitable and endless rise. But... just because one thing dominates, doesn’t mean something else fails to exist or can even thrive. And that is pretty much how we live with printed materials today. The demand is less, but their existence remains. And better still, the novelty of such material objects such as a freshly printed book, magazine, or screenprint tends to encourage greater care and quality when crafting and producing the work.</p>
<p>As much as I like to think ahead, excited by future technologies, there is still a place in my heart for the tactility of a beautifully designed and expertly crafted book. And so, over the past year, I have been working on Minimalissimo’s next printed edition: <em>Selection</em>. This project has a very different vibe to the three magazines that came before it. Not just through material changes, but also the entire concept.</p>
<figure class="img-figure"><div class="img-wrapper" data-tooltip="Minimalissimo Selection Cover" style="padding-bottom: 100%"><img alt="Minimalissimo Selection Cover" class="img" loading="lazy" src="https://carlbarenbrug.com/media/pages/blog/quality-return-to-print/2d7510fd23-1690029232/selection-arch-cover-clean.jpg"></div></figure>
<figure class="img-figure"><div class="img-wrapper" data-tooltip="Minimalissimo Selection" style="padding-bottom: 100%"><img alt="Minimalissimo Selection" class="img" loading="lazy" src="https://carlbarenbrug.com/media/pages/blog/quality-return-to-print/910cddbcd2-1690029231/selection-arch-pp94-square.jpg"></div></figure>
<p><em>Selection</em> is a visual exploration of architecture within the spectrum of minimalism. Like the flow of a carefully curated interior, this book will take you through an assortment of impeccable projects from outside-in, showcasing a multitude of styles, sizes, materials, and details. Minimalist architecture might be synonymous with the absence of colour, but with this book we aim to illustrate that minimalism can be applied in many different ways and to great effect.</p>
<p>I have worked closely on this project with <a href="https://ivanmoreale.com" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Ivan Moreale</a>. His art direction for this book has been incredible and our collective pursuit of perfection has resulted in something I am extremely proud of. Here is another truth though: print design is bloody exhausting. So forgive me when I say that it will likely be a good couple of years before I even consider venturing down this road again.</p>
<p>Anyway, <em>Selection</em> is undoubtedly the highest quality thing we've made at Minimalissimo and is currently available for order, which you can do via a beautifully minimal 1-page website I designed with my good friend <a href="https://manuelmoreale.com" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Manu Moreale</a>:</p>

            <title>Brutalist Web Design</title>
            <link>https://carlbarenbrug.com/@/page/J1spLCyvcgtZsk6c</link>

            <pubDate>Sun, 01 Jan 2022 00:00:00 +0100</pubDate>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>I recently read an article by Tom MacWright on <a href="https://macwright.com/2021/03/16/return-of-fancy-tools.html" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">fancy software tools</a>. Although tools such as Webflow, Squarespace, Semplice, and Notion are impressive in their own right and all fulfil specific needs, they are also needlessly complex (in a way). We have entered an era of design where everything is expected to move, be soft, be comfortable, be sensitive. And where everything must appear as though a designer has spent many hours crafting a portfolio with purposeful animation, well-researched typography, and stylised vectors, all in the hope of being subsequently recognised by design peers.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Webflow has buttons to add effects. It's easy to add effects. Effects will be added because there's a button to add them. Everything for the next few years will slowly fade in as you scroll. I don't know why. Stripe did it.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Fancy tools aren't bad. Professional authors use Microsoft Word and have absolute courage, phenomenal self-control to never fiddle with fonts. I, however, don't. Give me iA Writer to save me from myself.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You see, the complexity of these tools isn't in the ability to use them—they exist to allow web creation to be more accessible to non-coders. Instead, it is in the resulting designs that the tools encourage. Convenience can be a trap. So with this in mind, I think the web needs less <em>fancy</em> and more <em>brutalism</em>.</p>
<p>I'm not saying you need to hand-code a website using Notepad++ in its entirety. I'm saying that we should look to avoid being sucked in by fancy tools that silently set expectations that you should make fancy websites applied in precisely the same manner as their exemplary <em>showcased sites</em> have previously.</p>
<p><em>Brutalism: noun; a stark style of functionalist architecture characterised by the use of steel and concrete in massive blocks.</em></p>
<p>Let's then consider  <a href="http://www--arc.com" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">web design as architecture</a>. Malte Müller wrote about this very topic, which I would strongly encourage you to read, but allow me to share a few extracts that stood out to me.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Websites are places</strong>. They provide services and social environments. Like architecture, they distribute access and atmospheric context to these resources: Watching a video on Nowness is different from watching a video on YouTube.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Websites are constructed</strong>. Websites may use new technologies or existing technology to new effect. They may employ new ways of construction or cite old ways of construction. Similarly, material and construction are defining characteristics of architectural work.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Websites age</strong>. As buildings, some get better with age. Some decay. Others get renovated or re-purposed.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Websites are made by individuals</strong>, by collectives or by large-scale project groups, decisively influencing their aims, design quality, and building process. Similar differences exist between private construction and large-scale urban projects. There is value in each scale.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Considering these points as a foundational construct for web design can naturally shape our creative thinking—that's not necessarily a positive thing, though. We see some atrocious architecture just as much as we see exceptional architecture. But I do love the concept regardless. </p>
<p>So what is it about brutalism that is so appealing? Brutalist architecture not only reduces construction to its basic materials, but it also finds beauty in that simplicity. And that can be translated to the web quite easily.</p>
<p>Web Brutalism can pretty much evoke the same emotions that Architecture Brutalism can. They garner curiosity from people. They break the norm of modern websites. And kites fly highest against the wind, don't they?</p>
<p>Brutalist web design shouldn't be applied in all instances, of course—it largely depends on your audience. It also does not imply an absence of usability, accessibility, or readability. Even if these foundations may be present, they might not be so apparent to users. One of the most vital assets of a brutalist website <em>should</em> be its performance. Brutalism is honest and often brings together overlapping and sometimes competing influences such as essentialism, minimalism, and utilitarianism, therefore removing stuff that is far from necessary. This consequently should improve loading times. There is a bit of a rebellious or reactive attitude to this design approach. It is no-nonsense, bold, unforgiving, and raw. Yet not without taste; probably just an acquired one.</p>
<p>Pascal Deville, who founded the <a href="https://brutalistwebsites.com" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Brutalist Websites</a> directory after coining the term in 2014, thinks the style has splintered into three micro-stylistics:</p>
<ol class="order-less">
<li>Purists</li>
<li>UX Minimalists</li>
<li>Anti-ists (or artists)</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>The purists reference strongly to the architectural characteristics of Web Brutalism, such as the concept of 'truth to materials' and the use of the purest markup elements available. The UX minimalists, in contrast, see efficiency and performance as the main driver of Web Brutalism and even believe that the radical limitation of possibilities can boost conversions. The 'anti-ists' or artists see web design as an undervalued form of art and don't show much respect to the status quo and mostly get bad press.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There is no such thing as a definitive brutalist website. Much like there is no such thing as a definitive minimalist one. It is about applying certain principles or code of practice to a design to find a purposeful solution.</p>
<p>If you're a web designer or front-end developer, I will help save you from yourself. To help you put <em>fancy</em> to one side. I am going to offer you a <em>brutalism code of practice:</em></p>
<ol>
<li>Don't be influenced by tools</li>
<li>Use a system font and only one</li>
<li>Write clean code</li>
<li>Write your own CSS</li>
<li>Don't use Javascript (if you can avoid it)</li>
<li>Don't hack the scrollbar</li>
<li>Don't create custom cursors</li>
<li>Don't use an effect just because you can (especially fade effects)</li>
<li>Have as little design as possible</li>
<li>Make navigation obvious or not at all</li>
<li>Be practical rather than pretty</li>
<li>Don't use gradients or shadows</li>
<li>Use high contrast colours</li>
</ol>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>This week I was faced with an unusual situation. I was blocked on Twitter and Instagram by an account I have followed for a long time. An account and company I have supported in various formats, and one that I have actually invested in. Sounds odd, right?</p>
<p>Do I need to call them out? Probably not, because honestly, I don't really give a shit about social media. I use it merely as a networking tool and push out periodic content, along with a few thoughts that probably only reach a handful of people.</p>
<p>With that said, I was still quite surprised. It seemed a wholly irrational and reactive decision to block me. I have a reasonably good idea why it happened, though. I recently created a concept design of a device that was nothing more than an exercise in design. Far from a serious and intentional pursuit, I did it on a whim in about an hour. Literally nothing different to what you will discover on the likes of Behance or Dribbble. In addition, I clearly cited my inspirations, which I always do out of respect and integrity. I drew on specific design characteristics of others yet created something unique and very much in line with a design language you would expect from me. But clearly someone was offended. We do, after all, live in a hyper-sensitive world where people are quick to react at the click of a button without much thought.</p>
<p>Upon reflection, it is entirely someone's prerogative to block me for whatever reason they may have. That's not something I'll lose any sleep over. But, you know what would have been a little more rational? Taking the time to email me and explain their issue. Open an asynchronous dialogue like a decent human being where you can give your words and actions a little more consideration rather than acting petulantly.</p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>I have been longing for a more enjoyable and unpredictable web experience for a while, and one that is less focused on commercialism. I want my digital life to be immersive in a different way—one where I can get lost in the trees of the forest of the internet. To discover places, people, communities, and counter-culture that seem difficult to find and appreciate through certain digital mediums, such as social media. I am looking to leave that medium behind sooner or later. So when a problem presents itself, some kind of solution is sought.</p>
<p>I had a discussion around this topic with my friend <a href="https://manuelmoreale.com" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Manu</a>. We decided to build a simple tool to make browsing the web a little more fun and interesting. A tool that anyone can use and contribute to as much as they like. Inspired by <a href="https://theuselessweb.com" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">The Useless Web</a>, we made a one-page web plot to send you off into the web's wilderness to discover someone or something (potentially) new.</p>
<p>We call it <a href="https://theforest.link" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">The Forest</a>.</p>
<p>So when you're looking for a distraction, and you fancy a digital walk to find yourself down a rabbit hole, stop by and get yourself lost. Or if you know of an interesting place you think others would enjoy, please plant a tree to be discovered.</p>

            <title>3D Printing and Rethinking How You Buy</title>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>I previously wrote about the <a href="https://carlbarenbrug.com/3d-printing">beauty of 3D printing</a> and how in recent years, we have seen incredible advancements and accessibility to technologies that have impacted the health sector and everyday consumers. 3D printing is still a very new concept to most of us. At least in terms of making things for our home, office, or workshop. It's time to look forward, explore what is possible, empower ourselves, and make some changes to how we buy physical objects.</p>
<p>I am feeling pretty energised by the idea of making simple things that empower people (and not just creatives) to express themselves. And the field of 3D printing is allowing me to do that. Although I am not exactly providing a tool to people, I am encouraging a different way of thinking about consumerism and environmental impact.</p>
<p>Instead of ordering overproduced physical objects from the likes of Amazon and IKEA, you can buy and download a 3D model file <em>once</em> and print it whenever and however many times you want. You can customise your home to fit your needs. You can be far more eco-friendly and save a tonne of money by avoiding international shipments entirely. You can experiment with materials, filaments, textures, and colours. If you have the skills or desire to learn, you can even change the model design. You can take back control, lighten your footprint, and own some beautiful objects.</p>
<p>Have I convinced you yet? Maybe you're on the fence. You probably don't own a 3D printer. So how the hell do you go about printing the models? You might be surprised by just how many 3D printing workshops there are around. Most cities will have several. I mean, it is probably unlikely that you'll find one in a small village, but still, printing is super accessible these days. And suppose you're really into this way of manufacturing objects. In that case, nothing is stopping you from owning your own printer and making everything from home. Currently, I am using <a href="https://www.treatstock.co.uk" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Treatstock</a> as my platform for finding printers.</p>
<p>Maybe you're feeling slightly more persuaded and want to experiment. I recently partnered up with <a href="http://boem.studio" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Ale&scaron; Boem</a> to design a launch collection of homewares for <a href="https://minimalissimo.com" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Minimalissimo</a>. We made a <a href="https://minimalissimo.shop/product/jug-3d-model" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">water jug</a>, a <a href="https://minimalissimo.shop/product/tube-3d-model" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">tube-like watering can</a>, and a <a href="https://minimalissimo.shop/product/planter-3d-model" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">planter</a>. More objects will come later in the year, but I would love to get your journey of 3D printing underway with any of these. Support the notion, support a small business, and rethink your buying habits.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p><em>This is a response to Manu's post, <a href="https://manuelmoreale.com/adoption-sponsorships" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Adoption Sponsorships</a></em>.</p>
<p>How can bloggers monetise their content without going down the path of a paywall such as Patreon or premium newsletters? Donations are possible but rely on a small number of very generous people. A blogger definitely isn't going to make a living out of that. You could also consider affiliate linking, which is widely used. Yet, in my experience, it doesn't lead to much income unless you receive an enormous amount of traffic.</p>
<p>Like <a href="https://manuelmoreale.com" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Manu</a>, I am an advocator of the open web. I don't like the idea of paywalls to access worthwhile writing. So how can bloggers earn money without introducing a wall to readers? The answer is advertising, of course. But what if we saw advertising applied in a low-tech and unobtrusive way?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Let's imagine that you wrote a blog post that is referenced a lot on the web. A blog post that also ranks very highly for some interesting search queries. It wasn't your goal; it just happened. What if you could let someone "adopt" that article and that article alone?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Manu poses a good question here. Instead of site-wide banner ads and animated blocks demanding your attention, we can look to apply an alternative solution that is lightweight, relative, subtle, and benefits both blogger and advertiser. What would that look like?</p>
<p>Let's start with the basics—how it would appear on blog posts. Low-tech can mean <a href="https://minimalissimo.com/sponsors" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">many things</a>, but in this instance, like Manu has illustrated, I would suggest a single sentence text-only format. It would comprise a company name, link, and statement supporting the blog post to be read.</p>
<p>So far, this is very simple and not exactly innovative. However, you could take this as a foundation on which to build. Instead of manually reaching out to brands that may or may not be interested in working with you as a blogger, what might be an interesting idea is if there was a blog post marketplace for individual articles to be discovered and sponsored (or adopted). Presented as a listing similar to <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">LessWrong</a>.</p>
<p>As a blogger, you could share a selection of links from your archive that you are prepared to monetise, tagging them appropriately. It might be some of your most-read posts, or it might be something that didn't get much traction when you originally published it. You have an opportunity to attach value and recirculate your writing to be discovered while at the same time being paid by a sponsor.</p>
<p>What might be even more interesting is if this marketplace was created and managed by a community. Maybe it only covers specific topics, maybe there is a review process to accept or deny articles (primarily to weed out harmful material), and maybe each blogger has an opportunity to become a shareholder of the marketplace. A bit like <a href="https://mirror.xyz" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Mirror</a>, but less exclusive.</p>
<p>The marketplace might have a ranking system a bit like <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Hacker News</a> as a way to spotlight articles. Maybe brands can offer to adopt it at a price set by the blogger. And the adoption period can scale along with a pricing model. Perhaps pricing is based solely on cryptocurrency. These are details, though, and probably don't have a bearing on the overall concept.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the idea might fall apart entirely if brands are not prepared to advertise in a low-tech way. But perhaps with modest advertising comes a reduced cost? It's difficult to say.</p>
<p>In essence, I think it could be interesting to combine low-tech advertising with a discovery tool such as a blog post marketplace. Maybe this could even be integrated with a search engine in some way.</p>
<p>Maybe this is all nonsense, and we should just persevere with affiliate linking and paywalls. However, I think we should be exploring different ways of monetisation without compromising accessibility, reading experience, and a greater return for writers. That is the problem that needs to be solved. This might be one (albeit potentially complex) way to do that.</p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>An annual review of the minimal phone setup sees it considerably different from last year, yet a lot has remained the same. I am still rocking the iPhone 11 with no immediate desire to upgrade. Don't get me wrong, I think the iPhone 12 is a far better design than the 11, but I don't yet feel the need to upgrade at the moment—maybe by the end of the year.</p>
<p>In terms of my phone usage, I am still maintaining a minimal mindset in terms of screen time and volume of apps, but I have taken a bit more of a relaxed attitude with the latter. With iOS 14, it introduced a new way to organise apps and how they appear. Apple allowed the ability to use custom icons via the Shortcuts app, which was exciting to see, albeit a bit hacky. Many designers looked to exploit this feature and make the most of it. We saw a wave of icon sets, most of which were mediocre, so I decided to collaborate with <a href="https://www.studiolenzing.com" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Studio Lenzing</a> and design a refined and minimal set named <a href="https://minimalissimo.shop/product/slm-880" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">SLM 880</a> that to me, is distinctive in both style and quality. With this in mind, my Home Screen changed quite a lot.</p>
<p>So let’s break down the setup:</p>
<h2>Lock Screen</h2>
<p>A Minimalissimo series of gradient style wallpapers specifically designed to hide the iOS dock and blend the much loved notch. <a href="https://minimalissimo.shop/product/hidden-wallpapers" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Hidden Wallpapers</a> is available to download on the Minimalissimo shop.</p>
<figure class="img-figure"><div class="img-wrapper" data-tooltip="Minimal Wallpaper" style="padding-bottom: 150%"><img alt="Minimal Wallpaper" class="img" loading="lazy" src="https://carlbarenbrug.com/media/pages/blog/phone-setup-2021/74692932bf-1690029234/lockscreen.jpg"></div></figure>
<h2>Home Screen</h2>
<p>I currently have 35 apps in total (including system apps), with  only 8 apps used on my Home Screen.</p>
<h3>Primary Apps</h3>
<ul>
<li>Camera</li>
<li>Maps</li>
<li>Telegram</li>
<li>Instagram</li>
<li>Mail</li>
<li>Clear</li>
<li>SoundCloud</li>
<li>Photos</li>
</ul>
<figure class="img-figure"><div class="img-wrapper" data-tooltip="Minimal Home Screen" style="padding-bottom: 100%"><img alt="Minimal Home Screen" class="img" loading="lazy" src="https://carlbarenbrug.com/media/pages/blog/phone-setup-2021/1c5a53bd14-1690029234/homescreen.jpg"></div></figure>
<h3>Other Apps</h3>
<ul>
<li>Amazon Music</li>
<li>App Store</li>
<li>Calculator</li>
<li>Calendar</li>
<li>Clock</li>
<li>Contacts</li>
<li>Dropbox</li>
<li>Dropbox Paper</li>
<li>FaceTime</li>
<li>Find My</li>
<li>Freetrade</li>
<li>Memrise</li>
<li>Messages</li>
<li>Moon Climbing</li>
<li>PayPal</li>
<li>Phone</li>
<li>RingGo</li>
<li>RBS</li>
<li>Safari</li>
<li>Settings</li>
<li>Shortcuts</li>
<li>Slack</li>
<li>Translate</li>
<li>Uber</li>
<li>Wallet</li>
<li>Weather</li>
<li>WMU</li>
</ul>
<p>It is worth noting that I do occasionally download other apps if I need to use them only for a short time, but if I no longer need them, I delete them from my phone. All of the above are apps I use on a regular or semi-regular basis, with exception to the Find My app.</p>
<p>How does your setup compare? Are there any apps I should be considering? Any tips you want to share? Always happy to hear from you.</p>]]></description>

            <title>In Search of Alternative Community Platforms</title>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>Over the past few years I have been trying to seek out alternatives to the mainstream social media platforms. Although I wouldn't go as far as saying I entirely dislike them, I feel I could experience much better and healthier communities and technologies than those I have found on the likes of Instagram and Twitter. I have made some decent connections, experienced good conversations, and discovered some inspiring people on these networks, but they are few and far between and there's significant issues with them that affect me. I have modified my use of social media over time to instil better habits and time efficiency, so I don't think I have an unhealthy relationship with social tech, but it's not ideal. And I'm looking for ideal. Yet, to be honest, I don't know what <em>ideal</em> means to me. It's only going to be through experimenting with other community platforms that this will become clearer to me.</p>
<h2>Defining Community</h2>
<p>First, I need to ask the question: what makes a community? It is a word that is massively over-used these days. <em>At its core, a community is a group of people that come together around a shared interest or purpose for active and expansive collaboration and engagement.</em> Communities are built to listen to what people want and let them drive the evolution of what it is. The idea is to listen to what they are looking for and provide them the tools they need to thrive and enjoy being present in that environment. This can be said for both offline and online communities.</p>
<h2>Evaluating Platforms</h2>
<p>Besides the mainstream social platforms, I have found and experimented with a few alternative community sites/apps. Let's breakdown where I've looked and identify the pros and cons from my perspective.</p>
<p><em>Note: I'm not active on all of the following platforms.</em></p>
<hr />
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Platform</th>
<th>Pros</th>
<th>Cons</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Instagram</td>
<td>good creative outlet, creative inspiration, strong networking tool, visual timeline of interests and experiences, effective promotion</td>
<td>overwhelming advertising, highly addictive, encourages unhealthy comparisons and envy, limited web version, poor feed logic</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Twitter/X</td>
<td>rapid news, strong networking tool, clear timeline of events, effective promotion, constrained content, encourages self-expression</td>
<td>random obtrusive content, allows anonymity, encourages toxic and reactive behaviour, highly divisive</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Slack</td>
<td>invite-only, simple, accessible, expandable, allows breakout areas</td>
<td>disorganised, time sensitive, limited storage, distracting, targeted at business</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>LOT</td>
<td>innovative, utilitarian, transparent, uncompromising, creative, slow</td>
<td>expensive, unpredictable, limited community interaction, emo, feels a bit like a cult</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Urbit</td>
<td>growing community, collaborative, peer-to-peer network, web3 enabled</td>
<td>ridiculously complex, unintuitive, expensive, unclear, technically immature, feels a bit like a cult</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Discord</td>
<td>censorship resistant, invite-only, vast topics, moderation tools</td>
<td>ugly interface, too noisy</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<hr />
<p>A few honourable mentions would be Reddit, Mastodon, Are.na, and HackerNews. I have never really used those as an active member, so it's difficult for me to comment on them, but I occasionally use them as a passive reader. Are.na seems the most tempting to experiment with, but it also feels quite siloed with little direct interaction with other users, so probably not ideal. Great bookmarking tool though.</p>
<h2>What I'm Looking For</h2>
<p>I really like the idea of something bespoke and independent. It doesn't necessarily need to be decentralised and utilise web3 tech, although that does appeal to an extent. It should be a place where there are no distractions, no ads, no suggested content, and no interferences. It should also be accessible, simple, and intuitive. It should allow both synchronous and asynchronous communication. I'm quite drawn to the idea of setting up a <a href="https://matrix.org" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">matrix.org</a> environment, but it's probably technically over my head. As for communities themselves, I'm not just interested in a single topic, so I would probably be looking to join several. In terms of size, I think a good digital community should consist of no more than 20 people. Therefore, if there's constraints on capacity, it needs to be a gated community.</p>
<h2>Discussion</h2>
<ul>
<li>What is your experience with any of the aforementioned platforms? Am I missing something? </li>
<li>Where else should I look? (don't say Facebook)</li>
<li>Is there an opportunity to create something new and bespoke for a particular type of folk? If so, could it be easily replicated and expanded for others? </li>
<li>Would it be invite-only? </li>
<li>How would it be moderated, if at all? </li>
<li>Would it be secure? Would there be privacy concerns?</li>
<li>Can it be community managed?</li>
<li>What tech would be a good fit?</li>
</ul>
<p>Many questions and many yet to be asked.</p>
<p><em>Update: I experimented with <a href="https://minus.social" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Minus</a> and <a href="https://arbtr.com" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Arbtr</a>, but neither worked. Minus was interesting for a time, but soon become very noisy and unreadable. As <a href="https://urbit.org" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Urbit</a> continues to evolve, I'm going to give it another chance, if I manage to figure it out.</em></p>
<p><em>Update #2: I never got into <a href="https://urbit.org" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Urbit</a>, but I still watch it's development from a distance. My best hope at a community probably lies with <a href="https://lot-systems.com" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">LOT</a>, which has slightly rebranded, but is essentially the same. Its CEO is wild and unpredictable, with Yeezy-like vibes, but he's also clearly gifted and inspirational. So although I'm not interested in engaging with him personally, I do enjoy watching the vision of LOT unfold.</em></p>]]></description>

            <title>Web UX Design Is Broken</title>
            <link>https://carlbarenbrug.com/@/page/zF2Z2S9SwhIMP3RV</link>
            <guid isPermaLink="false">blog/web-ux-design-is-broken</guid>
            <pubDate>Sun, 01 Jan 2022 00:00:00 +0100</pubDate>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>I recently discovered a website that brilliantly illustrates the state of user experience (UX) design on today’s web. Please take a moment to use it and see for yourself how fundamentally broken and intrusive web browsing has become on the majority of websites we interact with daily.</p>
<p>↳ <a href="https://how-i-experience-web-today.com" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">how-i-experience-web-today.com</a></p>
<h2>The Problem</h2>
<p>You might need a moment to recover from that. A bombardment of overlays and pop-ups are currently screaming for our attention for purposes of marketing and legal requirements (GDPR). We have become overwhelmed with interruptions, whether cookie banners, newsletter subscription prompts, feedback requests, chatbot bubbles, dynamic ad blocks, or notification alerts. Web pages have become possessed, and we need a fucking exorcist to come to our collective aid. Now, that might come in the form of ad and pop-up blockers, which go a long way to remedy the UX horrorshow, but it’s a bit like locking your front door to prevent raving zombies from entering your home rather than living in a calm, frictionless, and uninterrupted environment by design. And that’s what we want—at least theoretically.</p>
<p>There is a certain degree of irony at play here. On the one hand, we have a million <em>designed</em> interruptions for whatever reason, and on the other, we are experiencing the rise and rise of UX and UI design. And sitting merrily beside those areas of expertise, we now have a wave of forked disciplines in the shape of UX researcher, UX writer, UX content strategist, and UX engineer. But we seemingly still can’t get it right. Maybe I’m overly sceptical, and this is just very early days in fixing how users will experience the web in future, but come on. UX currently encompasses roles that <em>appear</em> to apply considered design for users, rather than actually considering the user. Incidentally, I say this as someone that would now be considered a UX Engineer (unofficially).</p>
<h2>Current and Future Solutions</h2>
<p>For all the issues around the application of UX design, there are some positive signs. Companies large and small are taking design patterns and documentation more seriously than ever. You might be familiar with the term <em>Design System</em>. This system essentially unites teams to create digital products with a consistent user experience through a shared philosophy and design language. It outlines foundations, principles, breaks down modular user interface (UI) components, including use cases and code snippets, and it provides guidance on how to write and style content. It can be light-touch, or it can be extremely comprehensive. The scale of a Design System typically reflects the scale of an organisation.</p>
<p>Design Systems set a positive basis to work from, but they don’t solve many collective problems of how we generally experience the web (IndieWeb aside). Specifically:</p>
<ul>
<li>How do we find a better cookie banner solution for all rather than single sites?</li>
<li>How can we convert subscribers without interrupting their journey?</li>
<li>How can we better handle advertisements?</li>
<li>How can we integrate chatbots less obtrusively?</li>
</ul>
<p>I think some of these questions could be answered at browser level. For instance, how personalised, performance, and essential cookies are handled. I would love to see the removal of any in-page cookie UI element, regardless of how well designed it is. Browsers already detect cookies, so why not integrate an unobtrusive button group in the toolbar to accept and decline cookies? I know some browsers such as Safari and Brave block trackers from profiling you, but what we’re after here is the reduction of visual interruptions while respecting the legal requirement of user control. Here’s a visual concept:</p>
<figure class="img-figure"><div class="img-wrapper" data-tooltip="Proposed browser UI to control cookies" style="padding-bottom: 66.625%"><img alt="Proposed browser UI to control cookies" class="img" loading="lazy" src="https://carlbarenbrug.com/media/pages/blog/web-ux-design-is-broken/cbc3742abd-1690029235/cookie-browser-control.png"></div></figure>
<p>Finding a single solution to reduce the noise of marketing interruptions is a lot more challenging. How newsletter pop-ups and ad banners appear is up to the website owner—not the user. It is, after all, their prerogative of how they wish to market their own or third party products. Yet, there again might be a solution at the browser level that could work. We know browsers can auto-detect whether there is an RSS feed, with some adding a subtle button in the address bar to allow reading in an alternative format. A similar discovery method could detect whether there is a newsletter pop-up script in the page source. Browsers could prevent the pop-up event from occurring and instead add a discreet button to the address bar to notify the user that a newsletter sign-up exists. The user could then press that to activate/toggle the pop-up and subscribe at will. Chatbot bubbles could also use this approach for better handling.</p>
<p>I know browsers like Safari already block pop-up windows by default, which is great, but these pesky newsletter overlays slip through the cracks. They do this for the simple reason they are not external windows—they are <em>modals</em>. A modal window creates a mode that disables the main window but keeps it visible, with the modal window as a child window in front of it. Don’t get me wrong, they are effective in terms of conversion, but I do not doubt that they pester users more than they convince them.</p>
<p>These browser solutions are interesting to me, but I am mindful of the potential friction. That is, how unintuitive some icons might be to some audiences. And how cluttered the toolbar might become if sprayed with buttons.</p>
<p>That brings us to advertisement blocks and banners. Designers can make ads appear more subtle and carefully consider the layout of web pages, but there’s a limit to that. Advertisers have expectations and are paying for visibility and the prospect of interrupting the user to persuade them to interact. These interruptions offer the least value to users, yet it’s hard to see them disappearing from the web any time soon. Ad blockers are probably the best solution we have available to us at the moment. But the onus is on the user to configure this themselves. </p>
<p>Maybe that’s as good as it will get for us, but I hope browsers will continue to incorporate features to better protect and respect how people want to use the web. Beyond that, I am hopeful that website creators will reduce the volume of marketing interruptions and persuasive technology and find more creative ways to promote commercial offerings humanely.</p>]]></description>

            <title>Minimal Twitter Community Pilot</title>
            <link>https://carlbarenbrug.com/@/page/kdIfhwj1DqqeWdXN</link>

            <pubDate>Fri, 06 Jan 2022 00:00:00 +0100</pubDate>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>My search for an <a href="https://carlbarenbrug.com/alt-community-platforms">alternative community platform</a> has led me back to, yes, Twitter. Although I am still experimenting with a couple of other platforms, namely <a href="https://minus.social" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Minus</a> and Discord, this new Twitter Communities pilot is interesting. We're all aware of the trials and tribulations of Twitter, and we're also aware that it is not entirely without value. As I've previously mentioned, I have made a small number of decent connections with people there that have led to light-touch friendships and collaborations. So when this invite-only communities pilot launched with an opportunity to apply, I thought it would be cool to create one focused on minimalist design.</p>
<p>I applied through the Minimalissimo account because it felt like the most suitable and probably increased my chances of being accepted. Well, it was, and the community is now up and running.</p>
<p>A community has moderators and members. Each moderator can invite as many people as they want, and members can invite up to five people. I think it will be straightforward to grow on a platform like Twitter, but I am keen to keep the numbers pretty small. If a community grows too much, it ceases being a community. That probably means we have to ignore some requests to join, but it's probably a good thing in the long run. But who gets in? Well, I'm pretty open to that. Although other mods and members can invite who they want, I'll personally be looking at people's Twitter bio and recent timeline for relevancy and to see how active they are on the platform. I'll send them an invite if I think they'll be a good fit and likely to positively engage.</p>
<p>So what are we going to talk about? It's difficult to say at this stage, but we can share and discuss past, present, and future designs and concepts. To celebrate the work of others and use the community to request feedback on work of our own. But it also doesn't need to be too serious or intellectual. Shit, if someone wants to share a meme, so be it.</p>
<p>Like with any community, it's impossible to know how successful it will be or even what success might look like. I certainly won't be comparing it to any other Twitter communities. I simply hope there are some decent discussions and good vibes.</p>
<p>If you are interested in joining the <em>Minimalism in Design</em> community, <a href="mailto:&#99;&#109;&#104;&#x62;&#97;&#114;&#101;&#x6e;&#98;&#x72;&#x75;&#103;&#64;&#103;&#x6d;&#x61;&#105;&#108;&#46;&#x63;&#111;&#x6d;">get in touch</a>.</p>
<p><em>Update: This hasn't really worked out. I thought people would be interested in it, but it got very little engagement, so it's not something I am going to pursue. I think for it to work, you need people who tweet multiple times per day to keep activity very high, otherwise, it becomes stale and people won't waste time communicating there.</em></p>]]></description>

A couple of months since we went to print, I have grown even more proud of this piece of work. It's probably because of the feedback we've received from folks around the globe. And if you're unaware of what the photo book is all about, here's a quick overview:</p>
<p><a href="https://minimalissimo.shop/product/selection-architecture" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Selection: Architecture</a> aims to illustrate that minimal architecture is about more than refined design. It goes far beyond the desire for aesthetic pleasure. Free from clutter and visual distraction, minimal spaces quiet external influences and allow us to connect to our inner selves and our deepest values. Every design has an essence, and minimal architecture aims to draw out that essence by limiting the superfluous. Nothing is unintentional. By eliminating excess, minimalism allows a design’s true purpose to come to life. This book takes you through a gallery of international projects from outside-in, appreciating the details along the way.</p>
<p>Someone who got their hands on the book is filmmaker and photographer, <a href="http://antoniocarusone.com" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Antonio Carusone</a>. We asked him to make a short film to communicate the vibe we wanted when paging through the book. And what he produced was something super beautiful. And the music was produced by <a href="https://www.paprtape.com" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">PaprTape</a> specifically for this film. Check it out and if you haven't already, <a href="https://minimalissimo.shop/product/selection-architecture" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">buy the book</a>.</p>

            <title>Exploring Generative Art</title>
            <link>https://carlbarenbrug.com/@/page/uloqwk84AYz6kjZg</link>

            <pubDate>Sun, 01 Jan 2022 00:00:00 +0100</pubDate>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>I am diving into a new project that is focused on generative art. Before I go into the details, you might be wondering what the hell that is. Generative art is art made using a predetermined system usually applied in digital form. It's a process of algorithmically generating ideas, forms, shapes, colours, or patterns. Gen art allows artists to devise programmes that can be accessed and controlled by the public. And that is exactly what I am exploring as a collaborative experiment for <a href="https://minimalissimo.com" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Minimalissimo</a>. A pioneer of this art form is <a href="http://www.emohr.com" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Manfred Mohr</a> whose work has become a big inspiration for me as I dive deeper into its history.</p>
<p>With digital art comes crypto art, and you might be aware of the existence of non-fungible tokens (NFTs), but I wouldn't blame you if you didn't know much about them beyond a bunch of people selling jpegs and gifs for extortionate amounts of money. NFT is a term used to describe a unique digital asset whose ownership is tracked on a blockchain, such as Ethereum, Solana, or Tezos. If you want to learn more about NFTs, I would recommend reading Linda Xie's <a href="https://linda.mirror.xyz/df649d61efb92c910464a4e74ae213c4cab150b9cbcc4b7fb6090fc77881a95d" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">beginners guide</a>. Although there is a lot of scepticism in this space, and rightly so, I also find web3 technology fascinating and the possibilities of where it could lead—especially if you put profit and novelty to one side. You see, I don't really give a shit about selling a piece of art for thousands of dollars. I'm more interested in making the world of NFTs more accessible and approachable to those who wouldn't consider themselves <em>crypto natives.</em> That includes me and probably the vast majority of Minimalissimo readers.</p>
<p>Thankfully, there are some fine folk who think similarly. Namely German conceptual artist <a href="https://simonfreund.com" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Simon Freund</a>, Norwegian design technologist <a href="https://naero.net" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Anders Tangen</a>, and Swiss designer and programmer <a href="https://www.prelithic.net" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Linn Spitz</a>. So together, we considered the current use of gen art in the NFT marketplace, what we liked about it, what we didn't, and what we could do to offer a fresh perspective in the space. What we appreciate about programmable art is the countless creative possibilities, and if we have the collective skills and knowledge, we can make something interesting, unique, dynamic, and beautifully minimal. Conversely, we don't like the high gas prices and the high value placed on digital art, which is why we have decided to avoid the Ethereum blockchain for starters. Instead, we have opted for a much faster, cheaper, and energy-efficient blockchain in <a href="https://tezos.com" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Tezos</a>. We also don't like the scarcity aspect of digital art. That makes sense in some cases, of course, but to me, making something extremely limited and scarce goes against the concept of generative art. So we are looking to make this project as limitless and affordable as possible while also offering unique variations.</p>
<p>We are still considering the right marketplace to mint the artwork, but we have some interesting ideas to make the whole experience intuitive and enjoyable for people interested in digital and crypto art. When will this project be launched? I don't yet know, but we're really excited to share it with you soon.</p>
<p><em>Update: I have started a creative coding course so I can experiment with generative art concepts in future</em></p>]]></description>

            <title>Minimal Email Setup</title>
            <link>https://carlbarenbrug.com/@/page/iVOXHQf8JRscwBSp</link>

            <pubDate>Thu, 05 Jan 2022 00:00:00 +0100</pubDate>
            <description><![CDATA[<p><em>This is a follow-up to <a href="https://manuelmoreale.com/emails" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Manu&#039;s article</a> on the same subject. I'll cover my experience and some desktop visual results of applying this method.</em></p>
<p>Some people love emails. Some people hate them. Most of us experience both emotions. Yet there's no denying—as Manu points out—emails are still one of the most useful tools to communicate with people. What I think can make a huge difference, however, is the environment in which we read and write our emails.</p>
<p>For the past couple of years I had been using a wonderful email client called <a href="https://www.yourtempo.co" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Tempo</a> until the company sadly decided to call it quits in late 2021. Made only for Gmail accounts, Tempo is a Mac app that offers a beautifully minimal and quiet email interface. It encourages its users to slow down and focus by delivering new emails in scheduled batches throughout the day as well as some well-considered features to keep things organised. I won't bother running through a full review of the app, but suffice it to say, I enjoyed it a lot and I was disappointed to hear the end of its development. That said, you can still download it as a standalone app without any future updates. It still works incredibly well.</p>
<p>Today though, I need something that accommodates more than just Gmail accounts. So I made the decision to revert back to Mac Mail, but with an extremely minimalist approach. If you're someone who goes through life with 1k+ unread emails and it doesn't faze you, then this won't be for you and you're probably beyond help, but if you are someone who enjoys keeping your emails organised and inbox underwhelming, then you might just appreciate this setup.</p>
<h2>The inbox</h2>
<p>Obviously I don't often hit <em>inbox = 0</em>, but it never gets out of control. If an email is sitting there, there is something I need to action. You'll notice I have also pared back the toolbar and what information is previewed.</p>
<figure class="img-figure"><div class="img-wrapper" data-tooltip="Minimal email inbox" style="padding-bottom: 66.666666666667%"><img alt="Minimal email inbox" class="img" loading="lazy" src="https://carlbarenbrug.com/media/pages/blog/minimal-email-setup/69cda5c7cb-1690029236/emails-inbox.jpg"></div></figure>
<h2>The emails</h2>
<p>Here, I also pared back the toolbar to only include functions I need. I did consider using text only tools rather than icons, which I might still switch to at some point, but felt the icons used up less space.</p>
<figure class="img-figure"><div class="img-wrapper" data-tooltip="Minimal email reading" style="padding-bottom: 100%"><img alt="Minimal email reading" class="img" loading="lazy" src="https://carlbarenbrug.com/media/pages/blog/minimal-email-setup/4aa13c80df-1690029237/emails-reading.jpg"></div></figure>
<h2>The writing</h2>
<p>I've opted to compose my emails in plain text. Although I loved writing in markdown (in Tempo), there's something so clean and brutalist about plain text. Sure, it makes text links a little scrappy, but fuck it, I like it.</p>
<figure class="img-figure"><div class="img-wrapper" data-tooltip="Minimal email writing" style="padding-bottom: 100%"><img alt="Minimal email writing" class="img" loading="lazy" src="https://carlbarenbrug.com/media/pages/blog/minimal-email-setup/cd1face5ac-1690029237/emails-writing.jpg"></div></figure>
<p>And there we have it: a combination of Moreale minimalism and Barenbrug brutalism. That's not really a thing obviously, but I like alliteration. Anyway, go follow Manu's <a href="https://manuelmoreale.com/emails" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">setup guide</a> and and drop me a note if you have any questions or want to share your own setup.</p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>My home office setup has changed quite lot over the past few months. So I felt it was time to share the latest iteration of my workspace, which incidentally, I now share with my partner. So for starters, we now have two desks in the office. But I'll focus on my desk setup only.</p>
<figure class="img-figure"><div class="img-wrapper" data-tooltip="Minimal workspace setup 2022" style="padding-bottom: 150%"><img alt="Minimal workspace setup 2022" class="img" loading="lazy" src="https://carlbarenbrug.com/media/pages/blog/workspace-revisited-2022/3e3e8c1f97-1690029238/2022-setup-4-3.jpg"></div></figure>
<figure class="img-figure"><div class="img-wrapper" data-tooltip="Minimal workspace setup 2022" style="padding-bottom: 150%"><img alt="Minimal workspace setup 2022" class="img" loading="lazy" src="https://carlbarenbrug.com/media/pages/blog/workspace-revisited-2022/4d5a42946f-1690029236/2022-setup-3-2.jpg"></div></figure>
<h2>The physical desk</h2>
<p>The desk was not an easy one to source. I had ordered the first desk from <a href="https://lz-elements.com/shop/sinus-family" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">L&amp;Z Elements</a> in Germany, but that was a couple of years ago when trade between the UK and EU was still in a transitional period. But since Brexit was finalised, it became a lot more challenging to source certain pieces of furniture—especially from small retailers. Anyway, I managed to find a UK producer of the linoleum finish. It was important to me to have matching desks. Although my new desk is a little smaller than the other, the depth and thickness are the same. It sits on two black Sinus trestle legs also sourced from L&amp;Z Elements.</p>
<figure class="img-figure"><div class="img-wrapper" data-tooltip="Minimal workspace setup 2022" style="padding-bottom: 150%"><img alt="Minimal workspace setup 2022" class="img" loading="lazy" src="https://carlbarenbrug.com/media/pages/blog/workspace-revisited-2022/2ba025e375-1690029239/2022-setup-4-2.jpg"></div></figure>
<p>Atop the desk sits the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Apple M1 MacBook Air</li>
<li><a href="https://omoton.com/collections/l2-laptop-stand/products/laptop-stand-ld01" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Aluminium laptop stand by OMOTON</a></li>
<li>32” 4k Samsung Space Monitor</li>
<li><a href="https://ulxstore.com/?ref=jsgjlgr0jxed" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">ULX desk mat</a></li>
<li>Keychron K3 mechanical keyboard</li>
<li>Apple Magic Mouse</li>
<li><a href="https://lz-elements.com/shop/unit/unit-one" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Pen tray by L&amp;Z Elements</a></li>
<li>Microsoft Surface Headphones 2</li>
<li><a href="https://minimalux.com/products/travel-pen?variant=42113172865279" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Minimalux travel pen</a></li>
<li>A couple of MUJI sketching pens</li>
<li>A black MUJI notebook</li>
<li><a href="https://opalcamera.com" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Opal C1 camera</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Having spent about two years working from home in chairs not designed for extended periods like a full work day, I had to find a good solution that balances ergonomics with aesthetics. After a lot of research, I settled on the <a href="https://www.vitra.com/en-gb/office/product/details/physix" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Physix Studio by Vitra</a>. It's an incredible design that works so well in the space and finally offers me some decent back support. I actually ordered two, because having different office chairs would just be madness, wouldn't it?</p>
<figure class="img-figure"><div class="img-wrapper" data-tooltip="Minimal workspace setup 2022" style="padding-bottom: 150%"><img alt="Minimal workspace setup 2022" class="img" loading="lazy" src="https://carlbarenbrug.com/media/pages/blog/workspace-revisited-2022/7fd1017547-1690029255/2022-setup-physix-studio-2.jpg"></div></figure>
<h2>The virtual desk</h2>
<p>The digital desktop is kept obsessively clean. My app dock is always hidden by default and only pops up on mouse hover. This not only helps me focus on the app in use, limiting distraction, but it also allows me to appreciate the desktop artwork so much more. My wallpaper will typically be one the designs from the <a href="https://minimalissimo.shop/product/slm-613-desktop" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">SLM 613 collection</a>, but at times I just go for a solid dark grey colour if I need to reset.</p>
<p>My typical everyday tools are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Safari for browsing</li>
<li>iA Writer for writing and notes</li>
<li>Dropbox + Paper for file storage and documentation</li>
<li>Mac Mail for email (<a href="https://carlbarenbrug.com/minimal-email-setup">see my config</a>)</li>
<li><a href="https://beta.wando.app" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Wando</a> for to-do lists</li>
<li>Photoshop for photo editing</li>
<li>Figma for designing</li>
<li>Telegram + Slack for comms</li>
<li>Transmit for FTP client</li>
<li>Visual Studio Code for coding</li>
<li><a href="https://www.are.na/carl-barenbrug" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Are.na</a> for bookmarking + discovery</li>
</ul>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>A new design, a new version, a new era, a new chapter, a new wave, a new vibe. Call it what you like. The sixth iteration of <a href="https://minimalissimo.com" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Minimalissimo</a> is here and it's probably the strongest one to date yet probably the most raw and uncompromising. But before I break down <em>what</em> is new, I want to explain <em>why</em> we ventured down this path.</p>
<p>We are all heavily immersed in design whether we acknowledge it or not. Everything around us is designed in one form or another, for one purpose or another, or lack thereof. Yet, some of us are exposed to digital design more than others on a day-to-day basis. What I am seeing is a relentless wave of a particular aesthetic. I don't really know what to call it, but I can describe it as soft, safe, slow, and comfortable design. I don't necessarily dislike it, in fact, far from it. I think it has its place. But it seems to be absolutely everywhere and in every thing. Be it web design, graphic design, product design, or interior design. Why are we so desperate to find comfort? Realising this, I felt a natural pull towards something that opposes this aesthetic. A pull towards digital brutalism (yes, this exists). But what began as an act of defiance, later evolved into a genuine appreciation for what a raw approach to design represents: unfiltered honesty.</p>
<p>What does that mean in a design sense? It's probably quite subjective. I can only speak of my perception of it. Honest design does not manipulate people by pretending it is something it is not, or mask imperfections to hide shortcomings, or waste people's time. It doesn't aim to crowd-please, it isn't fashionable or a novelty, and doesn't rely on decorative elements or special effects that want to be seen as <em>design details.</em> Instead, honest design is considered, understandable, and puts utility first. It is has aesthetic qualities that make the experience of using it a pleasure, which happen to align with its usefulness. If it's a work in progress, it will say it loud and clear. If it's experimental, it will not set expectation. Ultimately, honest design is done with good intentions, regardless of the result.</p>
<p>Brutalism might still be a bit austere for many people’s taste. A common public perception is that brutalism became the architecture of a forgotten underclass that depicts crumbling concrete and ugly dystopian soullessness. Far from being something to aspire to, it was instead something to escape from. The name doesn't really offer a sense of comfort either: even though it derives from the French <em>béton brut</em>, for raw concrete, it still suggests brutality.</p>
<p>With this in mind, we might not have produced a trendy or crowd-pleasing design, but sticking with the notion of unfiltered honesty, I don't really care. As the late great Virgil Abloh once said, "I like it, so it's right." Ultimately, what brings people to Minimalissimo is the considered curation, not the package it is wrapped in. Yet, it is the experience of the gallery that encourages people stay, remember, and return. It is minimal, like thousands of other sites, but it is distinctive. And a significant factor of this is the intentional omission of our logo. We have created a unified and considered design that supports the idea that if you covered up or removed our logo, you would still identify that the product or site represented Minimalissimo. Only time will tell if we have actually achieved that, but I wanted to challenge myself to design something without having to rely on a logo to make it a brand. That, and sometimes our developer, <a href="https://manuelmoreale.com" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Manu</a>, just goes rogue and does whatever the fuck he wants regardless of what I say, yet 99% of the time I end up agreeing with him. So credit where credit is due.</p>
<p>So what is new in Minimalissimo 6.0? The structure remains largely the same as the previous iteration, but we have decided to broaden our range of topics while paring down the editorial side of publications. This is a bit of a hark back to the original version of Minimalissimo that launched in 2009. We overhauled the search and brought it into greater focus. I feel searches are fundamental tools for galleries and with that consideration, we wanted to create a search that offers a little more than a simple input field. Besides additional categories, we have introduced collections, which in essence, are simply tags. Our search has been lacking for years, so we thought it was about time to address that and make it a loved and highly utilised feature of the site.</p>
<p>A subtle yet significant change we have applied is the removal of sponsors in the global footer. We are no longer working with sponsors or advertisers. It's just not compatible. We have always been anti-advertising, but this is a step further and instead we have decided to go all in with our shop as our source of income. So naturally there is a stronger presence of our unique products showcased throughout the site. Of course, we still welcome donations from readers, especially from those we have featured, but any donations are considered bonuses. The reliance on product sales, however, will drive our will to collaborate and create new things to sell, be it digital or physical items. That alone is an exciting prospect.</p>
<p>The other notable change we have made is our highly adaptable and modular grid system, which we have emphasised through the use of high contrast. There are a lot of lines in this design, but I didn't want to shy away from that. I wanted the grid to intentionally guide the eye. It also supports the rawness in the design that we were looking for. You can see how well this works across our <a href="https://minimalissimo.com" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">gallery</a>, <a href="https://minimalissimo.shop" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">shop</a>, and <a href="https://archive.minimalissimo.com" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">archive</a>. They work in perfect harmony.</p>
<p>I hope this has provided a bit of context and rationale for the creative direction and I hope it's something you can appreciate, if not immediately, then over time. It has been a fun project to work on.</p>
<p>If you have any questions or comments about it, please drop me an email.</p>

            <title>The Losing Battle Against Social Media</title>
            <link>https://carlbarenbrug.com/@/page/kdrgic5goxMLdnYh</link>
            <guid isPermaLink="false">blog/the-losing-battle-against-social-media</guid>
            <pubDate>Sun, 01 May 2022 00:00:00 +0200</pubDate>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>I write without the intention of this being just another rant about social media algorithms. I mean, I will rant, but I will also explore solutions. So bear with me.</p>
<p>I think for the past couple of years I have been feeling increasingly disillusioned with some social media platforms, particularly Instagram. Since I started posting over six years ago, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/minimalissimo/" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Minimalissimo&#039;s IG</a> account has organically amassed a substantial following. The account's growth was something I felt genuinely quite proud of and over a short period of time, things were picking up good momentum. It felt like a great marketing tool and when I eventually tied in the <a href="https://minimalissimo.shop" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">online shop</a>, we were even seeing a nice impact on sales numbers. Our follower numbers also seemed to command a lot of respect in the design industry, which in retrospect is pretty amusing. Then things started to change. Let's call it an algorithm adjustment. We all love to hate on it and for good reason. The realisation became clear that as a result of this adjustment we as users of a massive conglomerate (Meta), have absolutely no control over what is seen by others. We are like kites dancing in a hurricane. Yet we persist. We adapt to their algorithms and we follow their rules. We think platforms like Instagram add so much value to our work but in reality we see very little return on our time, creativity, and curation. This might not be the case for large organisations that have deep pockets for advertising where they can force visibility, but small businesses don't. Minimalissimo sure as shit doesn't. So where does that leave us?</p>
<p>Well, we can play the game. We can follow the sheep while being guided by those who control things. Currently, that means more original content and more video. You see, Instagram is very clearly moving to compete with the unrelenting growth of TikTok, so the days of IG being a photo sharing site are essentially gone. There might be some semblance of it remaining, but using that method as primary material for your feed spells nothing but disappointment and lack of engagement. Unfortunately, in the case of Minimalissimo, creating video content is not really compatible. I also don't have the time to put into video capture and editing. Especially when social media is ultimately a support act to what I consider the product: the <a href="https://minimalissimo.com" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">minimalissimo.com</a> website. Or we can simply persevere with static images and curate a beautiful visual feed  and live in hope that perhaps the algorithm will once again align with this approach. I write this with a wry smile.</p>
<p>I wish I could just focus on the site. All I want to do is write a feature and press publish and be done with it. None of this added labour just to get the shit noticed. I could automate posting to some social platforms upon publishing an article, but there are limitations to that. So with the acceptance that unless I put money and resource into social media, things are unlikely to improve. Therefore, a change of strategy is required. I'm going to put Twitter aside for now—we are actually seeing <a href="https://twitter.com/minimalissimo" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">reasonable growth</a> and engagement (for the time being at least). And with Elon's imminent impact on the platform, it's going to be interesting to see how that evolves.</p>
<h2>Assets we control</h2>
<p>What <em>can</em> we control? For starters, the websites we own and our newsletters. That is where attention needs to be directed. The Minimalissimo web estate has always been my priority and that is where I ultimately want readers and followers to visit. Social media is simply a means to an end. Visiting the site is one thing, retaining visitors and gaining newsletter subscribers is another. Then there's a small matter of ensuring those subscribers are genuinely interested and engaged and not simply making up the numbers. I do have one regret: waiting until 2019 to set up a newsletter. It seems absolutely mental thinking about it in hindsight. I could have capitalised on Minimalissimo's popularity pre-social media and probably amassed several hundred thousand subscribers—an incredibly valuable opportunity missed. Alas, I was late to the game but at least I played, and from day 1, it has always been about quality over quantity. And as a result of this, our newsletter subscribers are only sitting at a couple of thousand and require double-opt-in to be confirmed. So growth is <em>very</em> conservative, but I want to explore ways of growing this list and with it, engagement and dare I say it, community. How do I do that?</p>
<h2>Short-term solutions</h2>
<p>This is a design challenge with constraints. How do you get something noticed without making noise? By noise, I mean doing things like displaying obtrusive pop-ups and modals that demand your attention the second you land on a site. I know this approach actually works—it has a strong conversion rate. It's just fucking annoying and sites that do it are typically forgiven because they are offering a discount on purchases in exchange. I don't like it, but I am not averse to some kind of subtle and significantly delayed subscription prompt. There's a right way and a wrong way of doing this and conversion is not the sole criteria. So it's tempting to experiment with. I might just need to convince <a href="https://manuelmoreale.com" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Manu</a> to code it, which is a challenge in of itself because he's not fond of these things to say the least.</p>
<p>Our new site redesign does have a comparatively bold and simple invitation to subscribe for updates, but it remains in the footer. I do expect there to be an increase purely as a consequence of this small change, but it won't be significant. A further refinement to this could be a link to a <a href="https://buttondown.email/minimalissimo/archive/minimalissimo-edited-7583/" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">newsletter sample</a>. I recently improved the design of the web version, so it's useful to refer to. Should there be a call to action in the header somewhere too? Probably not, but it might be worth considering. Could there be a small text-based invitation at the end of each article? Potentially, but given how succinct our posts are, it might not strike the right balance. Another potential solution could be to run periodic product giveaways with entry criteria being newsletter signup, but it does run the risk of fleeting rather than sustained interest and it feels very similar to the <em>discount on signup</em> strategy. I don't currently invite customers to subscribe to the newsletter upon email receipt of purchase in the shop either, so that's something I could and should address. Related to the shop, I could quite easily subscribe <em>every</em> customer to the newsletter (like most retailers do) under the guise of <em>legitimate interest</em>, but I'm not going to do that. I want people to intentionally subscribe. You can tell I am not very good at sales, right?</p>
<p>I could even consider migrating the Minimalissimo newsletter from <a href="https://buttondown.email" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Buttondown</a> to <a href="https://www.getrevue.co" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Revue</a>. This would then allow us to capitalise on our Twitter audience because Revue newsletters are promoted quite heavily within the bio of a Twitter profile. But then doing this essentially pulls me back into the shackles of social media as a reliant tool. And I don't want that. Plus, BD is awesome and I want to support <a href="https://buttondown.email/features/run-by-a-human" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Justin</a>.</p>
<p>There's a lot to think about there. Are any of the above solutions innovative? Definitely not. But the ones I might explore are at least honest and respectful. And I would much rather try to build trust with readers rather than treat them like a number.</p>
<h2>Long-term solutions</h2>
<p>Although newsletters will always remain a strong asset for any company or individual creator, there are alternative solutions to social media platforms. One such solution centres around the concept of go-to-community (GTC), which basically means creating a space for people with a common interest to meet and discuss feedback, challenges, ideas, and strategies around a particular topic, product, or brand, while at the same time supporting your business through raising awareness and referring your product to others. And in return they are given certain control over directions the business might go or in some cases, create a byproduct where they too can directly benefit.</p>
<p>Further to this, there is also an option to explore a web3 tokenised community. This might not be specifically for Minimalissimo, but possibly something that centres around minimalism in a more general sense. It might also feel a tad <em>new-age-nonsense</em> to you, but if there is a strong enough incentive and curiosity for people to join, then it could be a really interesting direction long-term. An example of its effectiveness could be opportunities to collaborate on product design between a couple of individuals or a group. The obvious concern with this approach is if you create a community, how does it scale and to what extent? How much time and resource would that take to manage? Would it ultimately be worthwhile? The only way to find out is to experiment.</p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>I first met <a href="https://manuelmoreale.com" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Manu Moreale</a> (online) about five years ago when I asked for his help to rescue the <a href="https://minimalissimo.com" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Minimalissimo</a> website after an unnamed agency created a shit-show that left me down a similarly named creek without a paddle. Since then, we have worked together on various projects and built a solid friendship in the process. And about three years ago I was introduced to his brother, <a href="https://ivanmoreale.com" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Ivan</a>. He is a super talented graphic designer and we worked together on a couple of small projects. I then discovered that Ivan is an avid climber and at the time, I was just getting into the climbing scene too. Since then, we have chatted almost daily about design, our climbing exploits, debates, and sharing our admiration for some of the world's best athletes, how they compete and how they tackle real rock projects. </p>
<p>So we decided that we should organise a trip. Originally, I had planned to visit Italy in spring 2021 in hopes that we were emerging from a global pandemic and experiencing some semblance of normality. With everything booked, I got sick (food poisoning) right before I was supposed to travel. By the time I was due to fly out, I was still in no condition to embark on a physically demanding climbing trip. So I decided to cancel. Plus, Covid restrictions were still pretty tight at that point, and although I lost out financially, in hindsight, it was probably for the best.</p>
<p>One year and three vaccines later, I was scheduled to fly out to Venice in mid-May. Ivan had prepared and researched loads of climbing spots for us to explore and I was super hyped to get out there. Then my lovely partner returned from her Italian trip two weeks before I was set to leave and she tested positive for Covid. Brilliant. Yep, I got it too. So I was pretty wiped out for about a week, but I had one week left to fully recover and obviously test negative. I made it, but only just. I was on my way to meet two good friends whom I'd never met in person.</p>
<h2>Arrival</h2>
<p>Flying into Venice is beautiful and quite unique. I've experienced that a couple of times now and it doesn't get old. The good vibes, however, soon relinquished when my baggage didn't arrive with me from Munich. A great start to the trip. It was eventually found and delivered to me a day later, so disaster averted. Courtesy of a gracious taxi journey by the ever-relaxed Ivan, I arrived at a remote farm in Cividale del Friuli. A stunning little place that is so green, quiet (besides the birds, farm animals, and church bells), and serene that it was impossible to feel stressed about anything. 10 days of beautiful weather, nature, intense climbing, and new discoveries were upon me.</p>
<figure class="img-figure"><div class="img-wrapper" data-tooltip="" style="padding-bottom: 133.33333333333%"><img alt="" class="img" loading="lazy" src="https://carlbarenbrug.com/media/pages/blog/ajde/bb18c7f17e-1690029260/ajde-7.jpg"></div></figure>
<p>My excitement was slightly dented when Manu explained that due to a <em>Salone del Mobile</em>-related work load, he was totally snowed under with client projects. And since <em>Salone</em> had moved to early June rather than the typical April, my visit was poorly timed. It was unfortunate, but also unavoidable. So although we managed to enjoy a couple of meals together and talk about new projects and ideas, it was a short and sweet encounter. Next time, Manu, next time!</p>
<h2>Osp</h2>
<p>My expectations for this trip was to receive a masterclass from Ivan—a far superior climber than I—and visit some beautiful new locations. The first climbing session was on rope and it wasn't even in Italy. We decided to take a drive over the border to Slovenia in a tiny village called Osp. The temperature was sitting at 30ºC and I was facing a challenging first experience with outdoor rope climbing. Given my inexperience and the level of difficulty with this crag, we thought top-roping would be the best way to ease me in. Even so, the climbing felt brutal. The rock was sweating, my skin was sweating, and my shoes felt like I was stepping on a wet floor. So I was over-gripping like a maniac and expending a huge amount of energy. I only climbed two routes and I felt like I just trained for an entire day. This climbing trip was fully underway.</p>
<figure class="img-figure"><div class="img-wrapper" data-tooltip="" style="padding-bottom: 133.33333333333%"><img alt="" class="img" loading="lazy" src="https://carlbarenbrug.com/media/pages/blog/ajde/843f65b3ba-1690029259/ajde-8.jpg"></div></figure>

<h2>Premariacco</h2>
<p>Waking up to about 20 itchy mozzie bites from the previous day in the forest, it was clear that nature saw this tourist coming. We hit Premariacco (the pronunciation of which I perfected by the end of my trip) on the Natisone river for some bouldering. Ivan had already scouted out several projects for me to tackle and maybe one or two for himself. Dozens, if not hundreds of giant yet smooth surfaced boulders scattered down a river are so much fun to walk over, under, and between. I felt like a 10 year old again. So we made our way to the first project and it was one Ivan had climbed a year earlier. A gorgeous looking rock with lots of tiny finger pockets. After trying his beta (a term used for which holds to use and sequence of movements to make) for a while, it just wasn't working for me. So I tried to find a new one that suited me and after a few minor adjustments I got it dialled. <em>Send, Swim, Survive</em> (6C): done! I'd be back another day for the next project.</p>
<figure class="img-figure"><div class="img-wrapper" data-tooltip="" style="padding-bottom: 133.33333333333%"><img alt="" class="img" loading="lazy" src="https://carlbarenbrug.com/media/pages/blog/ajde/5cf7d594d0-1690029254/ajde-4.jpg"></div></figure>
<figure class="img-figure"><div class="img-wrapper" data-tooltip="" style="padding-bottom: 133.33333333333%"><img alt="" class="img" loading="lazy" src="https://carlbarenbrug.com/media/pages/blog/ajde/f276ea65dc-1690029253/ajde-5.jpg"></div></figure>
<h2>DEŠ Gym</h2>
<p>Not all our climbing was outdoors. We regularly crossed the Slovenian border to train at a small but awesome climbing gym called Društvo ekstremnih športov (DEŠ). It's a super friendly place run in a part-time capacity with good vibes, a nice mix of climbing styles (without grades), and if you climb hard enough, you might just get a free glass of beer at the end of your session. I think we trained here for about 10 hours over the course of my trip and this was when Ivan could give me lots of advice about my climbing technique, asking me to re-climb boulder problems until I did it with more style, less power, and better precision. I always like to try something myself first, but I rarely get it perfect, so taking on board tiny details to improve my climbing efficiency goes a long way. And much of it translates to real rock. So I'm looking forward to hitting up this gym again next year.</p>
<h2>Return to Premariacco</h2>
<p>We returned to the Natisone river in search of a new project and we came across a gorgeous 55º overhanging boulder that was about five metres high. So we studied and cleaned the rock and found a couple of interesting lines; one for me and a more challenging one for Ivan. After finding a good beta, I managed to climb my problem within about three attempts. 13 moves on pretty good holds, but also moves that suited my height quite well. I think this is my favourite boulder I've climbed. From the discovery to the send, it was a beautiful process. So I decided to name it <em>Form Follows Fiume</em> (6C). The mood was high and I was psyched to see Ivan also send his project. His took a bit longer to find the best sequence, but after a few tries, he also sent his and it's an even more beautiful line than mine, albeit with a much scarier final move and top out. But Ivan made short work of it and named it <em>Form Follows Fear</em> (7A).</p>
<figure class="img-figure"><div class="img-wrapper" data-tooltip="" style="padding-bottom: 133.33333333333%"><img alt="" class="img" loading="lazy" src="https://carlbarenbrug.com/media/pages/blog/ajde/2ecc0d4356-1690029258/ajde-6.jpg"></div></figure>
<h2>Return to Slovenia and Drnulk</h2>
<p>Our next adventure took us back to the ever-green Slovenia and the stunning location of Drnulk. There is a crag within a forested canyon with plenty of interesting routes to climb. There is a range of difficulty here and it gave me a great opportunity to sport climb a few simple routes along with a belaying masterclass by Ivan's partner, Katia. Although these easier routes are not physically demanding, I am still really inexperienced with this type of climbing, so it was a good mental challenge for me. Battling fear is the biggest obstacle but when you become hyper-focused on how you move, the fear soon disappears. I can't say that will always be the case because when I get to the point of trying harder routes with a bigger chance of taking a few metres fall, the fear will probably kick in hard. But as I continue to improve and grow my experience, the fear will inevitably subside. Right? Shit, I hope so.</p>
<figure class="img-figure"><div class="img-wrapper" data-tooltip="" style="padding-bottom: 133.33333333333%"><img alt="" class="img" loading="lazy" src="https://carlbarenbrug.com/media/pages/blog/ajde/9ddeddda2f-1690029264/ajde-9.jpg"></div></figure>

<h2>Closing out the trip</h2>
<p>Given the beautiful weather, Ivan and Katia thought it would be a nice idea to have a BBQ on the Natisone river. After gathering wood and getting a little fire going, the three of us (+ Alice the happy dog <a href="https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/alicecanefelice/" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">#alicecanefelice</a>) enjoyed a really easy dinner with good wine while listening to the river as the sun set and the bugs descended upon me. It was a tranquil end (except when I stood on and smashed a wine glass) to a very physical trip and a good moment to reflect. I felt like I saw and experienced a lot in a short space of time, but there is still so much more to see and plenty more rocks to climb that I am bound to return for round 2. Or maybe I should just move out there! Or maybe just invest in a little holiday home to stay for a couple of months per year. Easier said than done, of course.</p>
<p>Holidays come and go and many of them blend into one another with very little distinction when we look back. Yet, some trips are unique. Some will be remembered vividly for many, many years. I get the feeling this one will be one of those. And I have to thank Ivan, Manu, Katia, and Alice for that. It was sincerely a pleasure. Grazie Mille!</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>In the summer of 2021 I made the decision to plan a house project. Not just to save, find, and buy a pre-existing house—that would be far too easy—and boring (unless you're doing an interesting renovation). Instead, my partner and I are opting to buy a plot of land in Scotland and build on it. And the build will be a prefabricated one. I have been drawn to the concept of prefab architecture for many years and I am so happy to see how this area has evolved in recent times. It used to be very hard to find designs that had aesthetic appeal, but today, many prefabs look incredible and are built sustainably.</p>
<p>With prefab, you can typically opt for various levels of service: you might just want to pay for the supply, you might want supply and assembly to weathertight conditions, or you might want the full turnkey service where the exterior and interior are built to liveable standards. The latter is definitely something we'll be opting for. Sure, it might be a little more expensive, but the whole appeal of prefab architecture is speed, efficiency, modularity, convenience, and stress-relief. Otherwise, I'd just be some mad-hatter like you see on Grand Designs killing myself with stress and near bankruptcy to design the perfectly bespoke home. I do admire some of those folks, admittedly, but we don't need to own an entirely unique home, particularly because our living requirements are pretty basic. I just want a well-designed, well-made, and energy-efficient one that functions as we need it to—now and in the future.</p>
<p>The project—<a href="https://carlbarenbrug.com/house">Barenbrug House</a>—is underway and we are giving ourselves 4 years to realise it to a completed state. We are already one year into this project with the focus currently being research and money saving. I want to now share this project with you. It's a big undertaking and not without obstacles (location being the biggest), but it's an exciting one. And I reckon you'll find it pretty interesting to follow if you’re looking to do something similar. Our home is our ultimate sanctuary for ourselves, our (future) family, and our pets, so it's only right to want to create something special.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>Care in design is ultimately about feeling rather than seeing. It is about being thoughtful of users—of humans. It is designing product details that you might randomly discover (sometimes even years later) rather than only designing what should be seen. Care in design is worrying about the small and quiet things like the way something has been considerately packaged or a fun interaction on a website at the stroke of a key or being mindful of accessibility for minorities, that in turn will receive a quiet nod (or tweet) of approval or a gentle smile. Care in design is design that is loved and appreciated by makers and by users—a feeling of connection.</p>
<p>As a designer, I would like to put more care into my work.</p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>I'm currently facing a design and marketing challenge related to minimalism. So I want to present a series of questions that you are welcome to help answer in whatever format you like (email, tweet, blog post, or meme).</p>
<p>If you run a website related to minimalism, is it only natural that you should embrace minimalism in all aspects (branding, design, content, technology, carbon impact and so on) or just selective ones? At what point does minimalism become detrimental to a brand or user experience? What is too minimal to succeed? What does success even look like for niche markets?</p>
<p>Does light-touch minimalism just get lost in the crowd, devoid of personality? Conversely, how can a more extreme minimalism engage without losing character or appearing boring and uninspired? How can extreme minimalism for a brand be consistent across all platforms such as website, newsletter, and social media?</p>
<p>How is the right balance struck? Is it even possible? Would you rather play it safe and be guided by metrics? Or would you stick to principles come what may? Or is it better to compromise brand distinctiveness and coherence for the sake of growth and algorithmic obedience?</p>]]></description>

            <title>100% Functional == Beautiful</title>

            <description><![CDATA[<blockquote>
<p>If something is 100% functional, it is always beautiful. There is no such thing as an ugly nail or an ugly hammer, but there's lots of ugly cars, because not everything in a car is functional. Sometimes it's very beautiful, if the person who designed it has very good taste, but sometimes it's ugly.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>– Dan Gelbart</p>
<p>This is a strong statement from Dan, who publishes an insightful and ongoing <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLSGA1wWSdWaTXNhz_YkoPADUUmF1L5x2F" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">YouTube series</a> on building prototypes. And it made me think about how objective or subjective such a statement is. Can a design that is 100% functional be undeniably beautiful? The short answer is yes, it can be. But is it beautiful 100% of the time? And does one fully functional design differ from another that's fully functional? Can it ever be ugly? Can a 100% functional object become ugly over time? And just because something is not ugly does it therefore imply beauty?</p>
<p>Let's take a step back though. How can something be 100% functional? What criteria determines such a rating? Even taking the basic tool of a hammer as an example. Hammers can differ in size, weight, shape, material, grip, and construction. And as hammers are designed for humans to use, one hammer may feel fully functional to one person, but to another it might feel unusable. Does its function then come into question? If so, Dan's statement might fall apart and open itself to subjectivity. Yet, the parts that make up a hammer are entirely functional defined by its simplicity, as opposed to more complex designs that may have attributes that offer little to no functionality. You could say, the more complex a product is, the higher probability for ugliness. </p>
<p>I want to believe in the beauty of 100% functionalism. It's an equation that makes sense to me. There's beauty in the ability of an object that allows you to perform something perfectly—it goes beyond aesthetics. If a design has been built to be useful above all else and it does so efficiently, effectively, and reliably, it cannot be disliked, therefore it cannot be ugly. Of course, things can be subjectively beautiful and far from functional, but that's not the point here. This is a matter of beauty determined by functionality. So can both be simultaneously objective? Or is there intersubjectivity at play here?</p>
<p>If you have an opinion on this topic, please let me know. I'd love to hear your thoughts regardless of your conclusion.</p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>I think I've spent almost every day for the past 10+ years thinking about design and designers, as well as architects and artists. Over that time, I've come to admire and truly appreciate the work of some highly notable individuals and teams, and others that probably fly under the radar of many folks. Earlier this year, I began a series on <a href="https://minimalissimo.com" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">minimalissimo.com</a> titled <em>applied design</em>. It's a curation of random projects from a range of designers from a particular country. During the curation process, it got me thinking about my favourite creative people from the past and present. So I decided to give it more serious thought and to produce a list. And who doesn't love a list? I did consider some kind of ranking too, but felt this was probably a little unnecessary, and someone's bound to get offended. I'll keep that judgement in the dome. </p>
<p>This exercise of favouritism does have a few benefits, though. It makes me take stock of what I value in design as a discipline, and whose work I've enjoyed as a collective portfolio rather than a one-hit wonder. It also encourages me to revisit projects that have made a lasting impression, and it might introduce you to several people whose work you'd never looked into before. Beyond just a list of names, I've decided to include my favourite project of theirs too, which has been a lot harder than I thought it would be. This goes without saying, but design is obviously a really broad term and I've got no intention of covering every form of design here. There are many types of creative people that I massively respect and would dream to work with (some again) that aren't included below. I'm really just basing this on the work I've seen and published on Minimalissimo or shared personally. It is, after all, a personal opinion (hello IndieWeb). And I'm going to cap this list at around 20, otherwise I'll be here forever thinking about it. I have also decided to split this into industrial and digital design groupings, sorted in no particular order.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>I enjoy books (more so audio books than reading), but I don't consume them very much or as often as I'd like. At least in my own mind I don't get through many, but what's the global average? I don't honestly care. This year I wanted to make a concerted effort to consume more books, one way or another. I managed 10. A personal record in fact. So if you're curious about what those titles were, here you go:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Hell Yeah or No</em> by Derek Sivers <span class="status">9/10</span></li>
<li><em>Anything You Want</em> by Derek Sivers <span class="status">8/10</span></li>
<li><em>The Practice of Not Thinking</em> by Ryunosuke Koike <span class="status">7/10</span></li>
<li><em>Invention</em> by James Dyson <span class="status">8/10</span></li>
<li><em>Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy</em> by Douglas Adams <span class="status">7/10</span></li>
<li><em>Zero Negativity</em> by Ant Middleton <span class="status">6/10</span></li>
<li><em>Sum: Forty Tales from the Afterlives</em> by David Eagleman <span class="status">7/10</span></li>
<li><em>Win</em> by Harlan Coben <span class="status">7/10</span></li>
<li><em>Homo Deus </em>by Yuval Noah Harari <span class="status">10/10</span></li>
<li><em>21 Lessons for the 21st Century</em> by Yuval Noah Harari <span class="status">10/10</span></li>
</ul>
<p>For 2023, I'm aiming to consume 15 books mixing philosophy, design, fiction, and biography. And I'll be starting with <em>God is Not Great</em> by Christopher Hitchens.</p>
<p><em>Note: I'm sharing this because my friend Manu requested it. He has <a href="https://manuelmoreale.com/end-of-year-book-review" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">a book list</a> too, which you should check out.</em></p>]]></description>

            <title>On Being a Slow Thinker</title>
            <link>https://carlbarenbrug.com/@/page/Y62G5ty23c3rKQXV</link>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>For a long time I considered myself a slow thinker. Meaning, I felt I wasn't particularly good at thinking on the spot and articulating what I wanted to express. Probably one of the reasons why I never do podcasts and why job interviews are met with such trepidation. But I recently came across <a href="https://sive.rs/slow" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Derek Sivers&#039; post</a> on this very topic and I found it so relatable. He explains:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When someone asks me a deep question, I say, “Hmm. I don’t know.” The next day, I have an answer. I’m a disappointing person to try to debate or attack. I just have nothing to say in the moment, except maybe, “Good point.” Then a few days later, after thinking about it a lot, I have a response.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I'm far more confident in expressing thoughts in text form, but even then, it's rarely an immediate back and forth conversation. I might need several minutes to formulate a response. That's not really applicable in person. You can't exactly sit and stare at someone blankly for 60 seconds while the cogs are turning to gather your thoughts. Live conversations don't work that way. There's no pause button to go and double check a reference to avoid a fuck up. We never like sounding stupid or misinformed. And you can't prepare for every conversation you have.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>People say that your first reaction is the most honest, but I disagree. Your first reaction is usually outdated. Either it’s an answer you came up with long ago and now use instead of thinking, or it’s a knee-jerk emotional response to something in your past.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>How slowly or quickly you <em>think</em> is not an accurate measurement of your intelligence. Slow thinking is, as Derek mentions, more deliberate and less emotional. Yet, with this in mind, I do sometimes fall into the trap of verbosely answering a question that I later regret, when I should have simply pushed it to one side until I was ready.</p>]]></description>

            <title>Reflecting on Minimalissimo</title>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>I was recently asked what my values are in life. It's a very tough question to answer without throwing out one word answers off the top of your head. And that's pretty meaningless unless you're prepared to elaborate on that word and what it means in relation to your life and experience. And one word that comes to mind when I consider my values is <em>perseverance</em>. It's something that I've come to know quite well in recent years. Ever since I took ownership of <a href="https://minimalissimo.com" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">minimalissimo.com</a> and began rock climbing, my attitude towards patience and perseverance has been pretty unrelenting. Don't get me wrong though, I'm very often left frustrated as hell too, but that's life. I can't control every outcome but I can keep trying, training, tweaking, experimenting, re-evaluating, and recalibrating.</p>
<p>Reflecting on <a href="https://minimalissimo.com" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Minimalissimo</a> specifically, day in, day out I've researched, curated, collaborated, and created. I've trialled a lot of different things with the brand over the years. Some worked, most didn't. But I always learned something in the process. It's a passion project, but how long can a passion last? And if I'm persevering with this project, then I must ask, to what end?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Perseverance: persistence in doing something despite difficulty or delay in achieving success.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What is success? To generate enough income to support my lifestyle as a sole project? The means to simply curate for the love of good design? To give back to the design community? To create a never-ending minimalist gallery as some kind of obscure digital art installation? At this point, I don't actually know. But what I have acknowledged upon reflection is that our level of curation for minimal design is incredible. Not just in terms of consistency, but continual improvement. <a href="https://minimalissimo.com" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Minimalissimo</a> has never looked so good as a digital gallery. And nothing even comes close to its level of curation on the web within this niche space. Call it positive affirmation, call it pride, call it confidence, or shit, even call it arrogance. The site is fucking gorgeous. So whether or not it makes me any money or <em>not</em>, this little pillar of the design community is still standing strong, carving out pockets of progress here and there to keep my love for this project as pure as a <a href="https://archive.minimalissimo.com/year/2013/chiyodanomori-dental-clinic" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Japanese dental office</a>.</p>
<p><em>Update: I'm tentatively planning on ending Minimalissimo by 2025 but keep it alive as a visual archive. The reason is to focus more energy into other projects.</em></p>]]></description>

            <title>Seeing Beauty in Basic To-Do Lists</title>
            <link>https://carlbarenbrug.com/@/page/IMXVrLUYLV0NfVqt</link>
            <guid isPermaLink="false">blog/basic-to-do-lists</guid>
            <pubDate>Sun, 01 Mar 2023 00:00:00 +0100</pubDate>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>I like making lists. A lot of people do. And this is reflected in the abundance of to-do apps available today. There's a silly amount of them. Designed to augment and organise our lives, they end up being far more complex and clunky than they need to be. The rise of the overwhelming to-do app (web and native) has probably driven a bunch of people back to pen and paper and I don't blame them. It's basic. It's boring. But it works. But it's also pretty wasteful. Especially if you're writing daily tasks. I prefer digital, but I don't need filters, labels, colour coding, theming, reminders, calendars, timers, prioritisation, or integrations. I just want a simple and accessible task list in a clean environment that's easy to use. Remember, this is just for my essential needs. I can totally appreciate that others might need some advanced features.</p>
<p>I've used quite a few different to-do apps to organise personal and work tasks. Some of them worked well but would have an ugly UI, some would be over-engineered resulting in a compromised UX, and others would find the right balance of form and function, but weren't particularly well supported or maintained. So recently I've been experimenting with some options after discussing the topic with <a href="https://manuelmoreale.com/" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Manu</a>. Looking into apps that are not specifically engineered to manage task lists. And I might just have found a tool that works well for me: <a href="https://ia.net/writer" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">iA Writer</a>.</p>
<p>If you're not familiar with iA Writer, it's a focused text editor with a simple interface that uses a formatting language called Markdown. It has evolved incredibly well over the years and in my opinion, offers a wonderful and unmatched user experience. From the typewriter-like environment, to the minimal and uncluttered UI design, to the clarity of the typography. I use it to write personal blog posts, feature articles, web copy, business plans, invoices, random notes, and now... to-do lists. I don't <em>need</em> another tool. This one works beautifully albeit a little imperfectly, but I'm fine with that.</p>
<p>My approach is like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>I only use the Mac version of iA Writer.</li>
<li>I have the app <em>always</em> open.</li>
<li>I have just one file titled <code>to-do.txt</code>.</li>
<li>The app is <em>always</em> set to full screen so I can tab or 3-finger drag to view it whenever I want.</li>
<li>I have a subheading called <em>Today</em> for my daily tasks.</li>
<li>Under that, I'll create a simple task list, which in editor mode, I can mark as complete as I move through my tasks.</li>
<li>If need be, I'll create more subheadings related to other topics. These are typically geared towards unscheduled tasks that I'll eventually get to.</li>
<li>At the end of the day, I wipe my task list and start a new one using the same file the next day. </li>
<li>Rinse, repeat.</li>
</ul>
<figure class="img-figure with-caption"><div class="img-wrapper" data-tooltip="Task list in iA Writer Pro" style="padding-bottom: 66.6%"><img alt="Task list in iA Writer Pro" class="img" loading="lazy" src="https://carlbarenbrug.com/media/pages/blog/basic-to-do-lists/9370d79ed2-1690029274/to-do-list-ia-writer.jpg"></div><figcaption>Task list in iA Writer Pro</figcaption></figure>
<p>As I said, this is still experimental. Give it a try too if you want to change things up. But if not, here's several alternative apps that might take your fancy:</p>

            <title>099 SPLY</title>
            <link>https://carlbarenbrug.com/@/page/iY1jEkVObtwXadHO</link>
            <guid isPermaLink="false">blog/099</guid>
            <pubDate>Wed, 04 Nov 2022 00:00:00 +0100</pubDate>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>In the spring of 2022, I had a call with Stefan Jandl, who runs <a href="https://favorit.studio/" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Favorit Studio</a>. As we have similar tastes and approach to design, we wanted to collaborate on a project together. Initially, we toyed with the idea of NFT art given its rise in popularity at the time, but it didn't feel right. So we continued circling ideas and finally arrived on what you might consider a fairly basic concept in a highly saturated market—product mockup designs.</p>
<p>As a designer, I'm often looking for mockup designs—usually devices—to showcase digital products that I have available in the <a href="https://minimalissimo.shop" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Minimalissimo shop</a>, or for other side projects. There's hundreds of mockup marketplaces out there, some of which are free and others paid—most of which are really pedestrian. There's definitely some mockup sites that offer a quality product range, a couple of which I've previously been a customer. But as Stefan and I began diving into our market research, we realised there was an opportunity to offer mockups as a service that goes beyond anything we've seen available. We wanted to offer freelance designers and creative agencies a cut above the rest both in terms of photo-realistic designs and customer experience. And on top of that, a highly distinctive brand and art direction.</p>
<p>So we created 099 (<a href="https://099.supply" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">099.supply</a>). Completely bootstrapped with a team of four. We chose the name 099 because we didn't want to constrain ourselves with a mockup-related label. Future thinking, we thought a numbered brand could evolve and potentially take us in a number of directions down the line. We also liked the idea of having a finite number of products available on the site. As the name suggests, there would only ever be a maximum of 99 products. That's actually still a massive number of mockups to design, so this is an ongoing process whereby we'll periodically make small batches available over time. Not only does this take the pressure off us building a massive catalogue prior to launch, it also makes sense from a marketing perspective. A new drop, means fresh hype, and means more eyes on the site over a sustained period of time. In theory.</p>
<figure class="img-figure with-caption"><div class="img-wrapper" data-tooltip="099 SPLY website" style="padding-bottom: 66.706730769231%"><img alt="099 SPLY website" class="img" loading="lazy" src="https://carlbarenbrug.com/media/pages/blog/099/80ff49f78e-1690029287/099-site-2.jpg"></div><figcaption>The 099 SPLY website</figcaption></figure>
<p>So what is actually different besides the finite volume? This is where it gets quite interesting. Typically, you will find a mockup that you like, download and customise it to add your own branding and so on. It's a basic process. With 099, we offer configurable options <em>before</em> you even download the mockup. You can find the perfect balance and save yourself a bunch of time editing within Photoshop. Then just apply the finishing touches once you've downloaded it. Beyond that, you can also download a cost-effective product bundle with ALL configurations. We're also toying with the idea of setting up a subscription model with mockup credits. But that will likely arrive when the catalogue is a little fuller. You might be curious to know that there is no AI involved in the design of these. Each variation has been painstakingly crafted. That's not to say we might not experiment with AI in the future.</p>
<figure class="img-figure with-caption"><div class="img-wrapper" data-tooltip="" style="padding-bottom: 66.666666666667%"><img alt="" class="img" loading="lazy" src="https://carlbarenbrug.com/media/pages/blog/099/114c5fd653-1690029281/002_laptop_angle_03_texture_03_lighting_01.jpg"></div><figcaption>002: Laptop mockup</figcaption></figure>

<p>As I mentioned, we looked to apply a distinctive art direction to 099. Although minimalism was a natural and important consideration, we didn't want to offer super clean-cut mockups or random colours. We decided to centre all products around a cube with a dark aesthetic—moody minimalism with a bit of character. Obviously this won't suit every use-case for creatives at first glance, but it's easy enough to brighten up the stage by swapping out colours and so on.

<p>We have launched with the first batch which you can now download. We even made one of the products free if you want to just play around first. I do believe using these mockups will elevate product design and branding concepts massively. We're just getting started and I'm immensely proud of what we've built so far.</p>

            <title>Design Ethos</title>
            <link>https://carlbarenbrug.com/@/page/h9aGYdCwXxcvI1UR</link>

            <pubDate>Sat, 07 Jul 2023 00:00:00 +0200</pubDate>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>I've been designing various things—principally for screens, and to a lesser extent physical products—since 2007. Only now am I writing an ethos—that is, my attitude and approach to design. An ethos is useful to me because it consolidates <em>my</em> design principles and gives <em>you</em> a deeper understanding of my thinking. And my attitude towards design has ebbed and flowed over the years. As it should. Because design is influenced by the world around us; by society, by technology, by nature, and by our mentors. We're in a constant state of flux, so we must adapt. And with that said, with time, we can shape our attitudes, values, and future by listening and watching carefully. So consider this ethos a living thing—subject to change always and forever.</p>
<hr />
<p>A reflection of good design puts simplicity and utility at the forefront, while often adopting an understated aesthetic. Good design requires human understanding, personal expression, and an open-minded attitude with collaboration at its core.</p>
<p>Designers have to be visionaries, but nothing can be promised—only proposed. We must identify challenges, ask honest questions, and problem solve with a systematic yet open and passionate mind to serve us in the quest to design well for the future. And as we learn from each project, each other, and evolving technologies, we can ultimately design with more efficiency, less ambiguity, better ethics, and with a continual sense of artful wonder. So, I want to break down a few foundations to explain further what I mean.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Simple</h2>
<p>Simplicity is the importance of clarity. It's about streamlining the user experience so design can be easily understood. Because who wants design to be a hedge maze? When something is crafted simply it will typically be intuitive and balanced, removing unnecessary complexity and distraction. My design process is considerate and purposeful where everything seen and experienced is intentional (unless it looks wrong, in which case let's just call it <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wabi-sabi" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">wabi-sabi</a>).</p>
<p>I avoid excessive visual elements and ensure an interface is organised in a logical manner, making it easy for users to understand and navigate. And there's always an intentional use of white space (empty area around design elements) to allow content to breathe. I always draw on the <a href="https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/gestalt-principles" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Gestalt Principles</a> for digital work. They form the basis from which to design with clarity and assist with understanding how humans perceive and interpret visual information.</p>
<p>An important characteristic of simple design is consistency. Visual elements such as typography, colours, icons, and spacing should be consistent throughout the design. Consistency enhances familiarity and reduces thinking time for users, as they can quickly understand and predict how different elements will behave. Is predictability boring, though? Well, sometimes, but it ultimately comes down to what a design should achieve.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Utilitarian</h2>
<p>Form follows function. That is, prioritising <em>functionality</em>, <em>usability</em> and <em>practicality</em> over <em>style</em> and <em>flair</em> to serve the needs and goals of users. But that's not to say it'll be devoid of character and distinctiveness.</p>
<p>Design needs utility otherwise it ceases to be design. A utilitarian approach puts user experience first. This involves understanding the target audience, their tasks, and their expectations by means of research, and then designing interfaces that facilitate the success of those tasks and iterating on them. The design is optimised to reduce the cognitive load and provide clear and straightforward pathways to desired actions or information.</p>
<p>Utilitarian design also takes into account factors such as accessibility, robustness, and performance optimisation (speed is important). Remember, we design for <em>humans</em> and human constraints. Visual elements are employed purposefully to enhance usability and provide visual cues that guide users. This approach encourages a design aesthetic that is typically clean, simple, and uncluttered.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Minimal</h2>
<p>Although minimalism plays an important role in my work, it feels more like a byproduct of my simple approach to design. I don't necessarily set out to make something minimal unless minimalism is, or is related to, the subject matter. Yet, it's really rewarding stripping back a design—inside and out—to find the lightest solution. That goes for form, function, and performance. Some may argue that minimal design lacks character, but I would argue that if something is honest, fast, clear, and focused, it is far more enjoyable to use. And a minimal design can still be interactive and lighthearted. Loud design might impress you initially as it demands attention, but that feeling is unlikely to last. Loud design tries too hard to impress, whereas minimalism is effortless and approachable while cutting out the ornamentation; that is, redundant components. And this makes for a better and more immersive user experience. It'll also avoid falling victim to trends.</p>
<p>I'd consider minimal design a combination of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>A byproduct of simple design:</strong> Simplicity is at the core of anything that represents minimalism. A simple approach to design is the only way to find its purest form.</li>
<li><strong>Understated:</strong> It is quiet, restrained, and modest yet expresses elegance and refinement through detail.</li>
<li><strong>Exposes its essence to communicate its value:</strong> For a design to be appreciated, it must focus on the essential aspects. It must be devoid of unnecessary features to make it as clear and understandable as possible.</li>
<li><strong>Geometric:</strong> Its composition reflects pure and well-structured forms to emphasise the precision and intentionality of its development.</li>
<li><strong>A balance of form and function:</strong> By means of a well-executed build, it demonstrates the importance of aesthetics without compromising its core functionality and usefulness.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Experimental</h2>
<p>Form follows feeling, just as form follows function. Sometimes we need spices of wonder and unpredictability in what we craft to spark emotion. That's where the fun, curiosity, and personal expression lies. Conversely, we want to avoid needless questions and wasted time, so at its core, a design should still be understandable and performant.</p>
<p>Experimental design can appear in many forms and be applied to varying degrees. I wouldn't say I question conventional design practices, but I do like to push certain boundaries and embrace the unknown. Because it can lead to surprising results. I find experimenting through interdisciplinary <em>collaboration</em> as something that leads to good energy and good creative output. A cross-pollination of ideas fosters innovation and unique design solutions. I've proudly collaborated on many projects including <a href="https://theforest.link" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">The Forest</a>, <a href="https://099.supply" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">099</a>, <a href="https://mnmll.ist" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">MNMLLIST</a>, <a href="https://carlbarenbrug.com/3d-printing-minimalissimo">3D printed objects</a>, and conducted countless experiments on <a href="https://minimalissimo.com" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Minimalissimo</a> with varying results. And even if something doesn't work the first, second, or third time, there is always insights to learn from—to help form better solutions.</p>
<p>While experimental design may not always result in immediate adoption, it does fuel creativity, sparks imagination, and serves as a platform for trying new things. And we need more of that in design.</p>]]></description>

            <title>Create Slowly</title>
            <link>https://carlbarenbrug.com/@/page/Zd7Uj9e0TKseULJB</link>
            <guid isPermaLink="false">blog/create-slowly</guid>
            <pubDate>Sat, 07 Jul 2023 00:00:00 +0200</pubDate>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>The concept of <em>slow design</em> is one I've applied for several years. As time passes (quickly) and new technologies land on our desks, the expectation that we need to react at lightning speed to prove to the world we're always in the know of what's trending, is exhausting. Even if you love tech, and I do, you'll feel it sooner or later. We're endlessly bombarded with choices, jargon, reviews, monthly recurring revenues, and so on—that make us feel pressured, envious, and overwhelmed. But we need to bring balance to the pace at which we encounter the world and encourage a different velocity of engagement and creation. To fight against needless disruption so we can stay focused.</p>
<p>A core characteristic of creating slowly is <em>patience</em>. Being patient with ourself to:</p>
<ul>
<li>problem solve</li>
<li>become proficient at certain tooling</li>
<li>understand technologies and languages</li>
<li>think creatively</li>
<li>think critically</li>
<li>produce something of quality</li>
</ul>
<p>Slow design is about embracing the time-consuming process of trial and error so we can figure out the most elegant, considered, and sustainable solution. Being mindful of a product's lifecycle is where enduring design originates. But it's not just about being patient with ourself. Often, we work with and depend on others to see a product evolve. Appreciating that people work differently is important. It can be both a blessing and a curse at times. But when something is out of our control, all we can do is communicate openly and regularly so collaborative design will flourish (eventually).</p>
<p>When reflecting on an achievement, people often say that it's not the act of succeeding that's most satisfying. It's the process of getting there. I feel exactly the same. Design is not just about the end product. It's the journey <em>that</em> design has taken to be visualised, prototyped, iterated upon, tested, fine-tuned, and realised. For me, this is only approach to finding satisfaction and pride in my work.</p>

            <title>My Ikigai</title>
            <link>https://carlbarenbrug.com/@/page/5aN0aEgnH8QPCZup</link>
            <guid isPermaLink="false">blog/my-ikigai</guid>
            <pubDate>Sun, 01 Aug 2023 00:00:00 +0200</pubDate>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>I first came across the <a href="https://positivepsychology.com/ikigai/" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">philosophy of ikigai</a> when I discovered and read the book by the same name. A <a href="https://literal.club/book/francesc-miralles-hector-garcia-ikigai-o91vv" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">book</a> written by Francesc Miralles and Héctor García. It's the Japanese word that signifies 'a reason to live' or 'a reason to get out of bed in the morning'. It's a state of balance that represents the intersection of enjoyment, satisfaction, and contribution. And it's no surprise that knowing your ikigai can give you energy and help you live longer with greater happiness.</p>
<p>We spend our lives striving to find purpose. To be useful. To be challenged. To find something we're good at. And something we can continually enjoy. To connect with self and with others. Recognising your ikigai might be simple, or it might be something you've yet to discover. It might not be a single thing either. You might have several interests or activities that you're passionate about. These will probably shift over time as you grow or change your lifestyle. We live through and experience multiple chapters in life and we shouldn't have to attach ourselves to things, people, and expectations for the entirety of our lives. So your ikigai today, might not be your ikigai tomorrow, or in five, ten, even fifty years from now.</p>
<p>It's a strange thing, reading this book. As I made my way through the opening chapters and got a grasp of what ikigai means, I was unsure determining what mine was. Yet, the moment I turned the last page, it struck me. I have a lot diverse interests in life. Most of them simple pleasures that range between physical activities and technical craft. But none more so than <em>rock climbing</em> and <em>understanding minimalism</em>.</p>
<hr />
<p>Climbing wasn't even on my radar until 2019 after watching the documentary <em>Free Solo</em>, which sees Alex Honnold solo climb (no safety equipment) El Capitan's 900-metre vertical rock face at Yosemite National Park. That took me down a rabbit hole of climbing disciplines and professional climbers, and it pushed me to give the thing a try myself (albeit indoors and only a few metres high). I loved it immediately and I haven't looked back since. Not only is it an incredible physical challenge that works every part of the body, it also has a huge mental aspect to it—battling fear, problem solving of the finest details, and when facing the real rock, being out in nature. I go to sleep dreaming about how to move my body across a piece of rock (real or artificial). I have an endless and sometimes frustrating drive to push my body to achieve certain goals in both bouldering and sport climbing disciplines—pushing <a href="https://paper.dropbox.com/doc/Climbing-Logbook--B~2v5DJmnsPrLg2RXw4UUPM2AQ-XpeSkORZEbN4mZ3hEeqtk" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">my numbers</a>. Numbers not to distract, but to give a sense of mission. Yet, the process of learning to move efficiently is often more rewarding than the success of completing a climb. I am only competing against myself and there's a certain serenity to that. Beyond the physical benefits, this sport is hugely social and inclusive. I have met some wonderful people, shared memorable moments, and that sense of community, which I do my best to encourage, is reason enough to turn up day after day with energy.</p>
<hr />
<p>Product design is my primary occupation and crafting things for screens is something I enjoy doing year after year. It poses an endless creative challenge to keep pace with standards, emerging tech, peers, trends, and sometimes defying those trends in the pursuit of simplicity. And through simplicity, I find myself diving deeper into the principle of <em>minimalism</em> and understanding its nuances. I have a focus and determination to find the purest solution to communicate with people through visual design. But I also see myself as a student constantly learning about the application of minimalism across art, design, and daily life. Exploring geometric forms, pure aesthetics, reductiveness, essentialism, intentionality, and sustainability. Across different disciplines, timelines, and cultures. And creating a readership around this topic is hugely motivating for me.</p>
<hr />
<p>These two areas of my life satisfy different aspects of my ikigai. Motivation and fulfilment come in the form of small details. With climbing, it could be unlocking a particular sequence of movements or finding <em>flow</em>, it could be completing a long-term project that I've trained weeks in preparation for, or it could simply be travelling with friends to visit a part of the world that offers a wonderful natural environment. With understanding minimalism, it could be discovering and showcasing perfect examples of <a href="https://minimalissimo.com" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">applied design</a>, it could be reducing the number of items I own to relieve clutter and improve focus, or it could be learning how minimalism has impacted the lives of others and sharing those experiences as a source of encouragement and inspiration.</p>
<hr />
<p>Are there other things I want to do in life? Absolutely. So things will likely change in future. But it's hard to tell. Although new interests are inevitable, not everything will give me a sense of purpose. And that's okay. Because today is what's important.</p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>I try not to pay too much attention to time, but sometimes it's hard to ignore. It passes far too quickly for my liking, but that's also because I'm nearing an age of self-reflection, but let's not go there! I enjoy routine and with that, life can get a little hazy albeit structured. The beginning of a year can look much like the end of one. But I'm making a concerted effort to take stock of how I want to spend my time, what gives me energy, what projects I'm involved in, and how much bandwidth I have available to make a meaningful impact on those projects.</p>
<p>I'm actively involved in at least three major projects outside of my product design day job. They're ongoing, so they require some creative continuity and periodic injections of strategic thinking. But it's not all business and analytics, there's some playfulness sprinkled throughout, but these projects also aren't playgrounds. They're companies I'd like to see succeed both creatively and financially. But as time passes and I catch a glimpse of where I stand in relation to these companies, I'm increasingly convinced my bandwidth is running out and my motivation is dwindling. So something's got to give.</p>
<p>2024 is going to be a year of change. I'll be stepping back from one or two projects and perhaps open the door to new opportunities if they present themselves. I want to be in a position where I can say 'yes' to the right things without stretching myself too thin. And until then, I can focus on and give more energy to that which remains. The result of doing this will be undoubtedly positive.</p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>If you're unfamiliar with <a href="https://www.producthunt.com/" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Product Hunt</a>, it's a platform used to share and discover new digital products. Its usefulness has probably waned a lot in recent years unless you're prepared to inject an advertising budget, but I still think there's value in sharing projects organically. There's simply nothing to lose.</p>
<p>You might recall that in the spring of 2023, I started a company called <a href="https://099.supply" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">099 Supply</a>. We craft digital tools for creatives, with our first batch of tools being photorealistic product mockups engineered for graphic designers. We've now produced 15 products to date, one of which is free to download and experiment with.</p>
<p>We've received some useful customer feedback and validation since launch, which has helped shape some of our work in recent months, but we're looking for more. This is the main driver to share a campaign on Product Hunt. I'm also hopeful of reaching a new audience and possibly a boost in traffic, but it's certainly not an expectation.</p>
<p>If you're an active user of Product Hunt, I'd massively appreciate your support by upvoting 099 and sharing sharing any feedback you might have. Hell, you can even create a free account just for this purpose if you're feeling generous with your time. Thank you. I owe you a brew ♡</p>

            <title>Taking a Step Back from Minimalissimo</title>
            <link>https://carlbarenbrug.com/@/page/kUOD2PV3ByRVXYuA</link>
            <guid isPermaLink="false">blog/minimalissimo-departure</guid>
            <pubDate>Wed, 04 Dec 2023 00:00:00 +0100</pubDate>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>I recently wrote about <a href="https://carlbarenbrug.com/bandwidth">bandwidth</a> and how I've been struggling to balance my day job as a product designer with several side projects and businesses. Reflecting deeply this year, I've decided to make a few changes, one of which is the difficult decision to step back from <a href="https://minimalissimo.com" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Minimalissimo</a>, a project I've passionately run for over 10 years. The reasons are varied, but primarily, it's due to my diminishing motivation.</p>
<p>I feel I've taken Mimo (as I call it) as far as I can, both as a growing business and as a digital gallery of design. Curating the finest examples of minimalist works and shaping revenue streams to sustain the site has been a fulfilling challenge. Mimo is globally recognised as the home of <em>minimalism in design</em> and has attracted a consistent readership since its inception. Mimo is also self-sufficient, covering its costs month after month, year after year, even amid the relentless competition for attention from other publications and social media platforms. However, I've never drawn a salary from it, so when I speak of sustainability, it's with a grain of salt.</p>
<p>To clarify, Mimo isn't going away. Instead, I'm happily passing the daily management of the site and newsletter to my dear friend <a href="https://manuelmoreale.com" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Manu</a>, starting in January. He's been an integral, though silent, partner for years, making this transition feel natural. I trust he'll maintain the site's smooth operation, sprinkling in some experimentation here and there (he's already warned me). I'm excited to see it evolve! My involvement will be limited, adopting a more hands-off approach. This shift will also see us pausing all social media activities to focus exclusively on the website and newsletter.</p>
<p>As for me, I'll be dedicating more time to <a href="https://099.supply" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">099.supply</a> and <a href="https://minimalism.com" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">minimalism.com</a> in 2024. The latter will be kicking off the new year with an entirely new website, art direction, and purpose. It might actually be my best work yet (if things come together as intended). I need some fresh motivation, new challenges, and most importantly some white space to welcome any surprises or opportunities.</p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<ol>
<li>Personalisation sells, but good design satisfies.</li>
<li>Don't wait for perfect execution. Ship and iterate.</li>
<li>You don't need to fill your time. Creating calendar white space provides a buffer for work and play.</li>
<li>Find the intersection of doing what makes you happy, what is smart for you long-term, and what is useful to others. Whatever that is, do it often.</li>
<li>Ideas are worth nothing unless executed. They are just a multiplier. Execution is worth millions.</li>
<li>The extremes inform the mean, but not vice versa. Design for the edge-cases; the middle will take care of itself.</li>
<li>Friends are not forever, but they enrich our lives like no others can.</li>
<li>Age should never hold back your confidence.</li>
<li>Drinking enough water in a day is actually pretty hard.</li>
<li>Nobody cares <em>how many</em> books you've read. People care <em>what</em> books you've read. And timing can determine quality. The impact a book can have on you is dependent on where you are in life.</li>
<li>Don't dwell on augmenting your life. Self-care is more important than you probably think.</li>
<li>Move to your own rhythm. This is where progress is realised. Keeping pace with others is a losing battle.</li>
<li>How slowly or quickly you think is not an accurate measurement of your intelligence. Slow thinking is more deliberate and less emotional.</li>
<li>Just because AI is available, doesn't mean you <em>need</em> it in your product.</li>
<li>Personal websites and newsletters are far more valuable than any social media presence.</li>
<li>You can’t teach minimalism to somebody who hasn’t felt the pain of having too much stuff.</li>
<li>Solo projects evolve faster, but collaborative projects evolve better.</li>
<li>We don't need a million followers. And maybe we don't need a thousand true fans. But we probably could use ten good internet friends to make our digital life better.</li>
<li>Email is the best form of communication. Especially if you write informally.</li>
<li>It's okay to obsess over numbers, but only if they give a sense of mission rather than distraction.</li>

            <title>Minimalism Life&#174;: A New Chapter</title>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>This week sparked a new chapter, direction, and era for Minimalism Life®, a project I cofounded in 2016. Almost 8 years on from then, with much experimentation, many highs and lows, strategy changes, and a lot of ground work, we announced the relaunch of our website: <a href="https://minimalism.com" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">minimalism.com</a></p>
<figure class="img-figure with-caption"><div class="img-wrapper" data-tooltip="" style="padding-bottom: 66.65%"><img alt="" class="img" loading="lazy" src="https://carlbarenbrug.com/media/pages/blog/ml-launch/1f88284386-1705673093/desktop-pro-display.jpg"></div><figcaption>A special domain for a special project</figcaption></figure>
<p>I'll be totally honest, though, for years we didn't really know what to do with this project. We knew we wanted to create a collaborative space around the topic of <em>minimalism</em>, but it never really took shape. The first several years of this project was mostly focused on experimenting with different publication formats, building up a newsletter readership, and securing social media handles. But to what end? I honestly didn't know and I began to feel really disillusioned with the project. There was nothing original about what we were trying to say. So I took a small step back to gain a better perspective on things.</p>
<hr />
<p>The turning point was when we managed to secure <a href="https://minimalism.com" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">minimalism.com</a>; it was a wake-up call that we needed to do something that justifies owning a name like that. Something engaging, educational, aesthetic, simple, and enjoyable to continually work on and sustainably evolve.</p>
<p>After a period of reduced involvement in the project's direction, I took the reins again in 2023 and led the company through a transformation of sorts. We wanted to create a platform dedicated to promoting the principles and nuances of minimalism through curated resources, creative initiatives, and community experiences. With a focus on cross-discipline simplicity, sustainability, and intentionality, the rebooted Minimalism Life® provides a wealth of resources, articles, and visual inspiration for individuals seeking to apply minimalism as a tool to augment their personal and creatives lives.</p>
<p>The site is for those seeking a quiet place to return to for continual inspiration and insight without feeling over-stimulated by the often overwhelming volume of information the web has to offer. It’s a slow, iterative, and evolving road and it feels like we’re just getting started.</p>
<hr />
<p>On a technical note, the new site has been built on <a href="https://getkirby.com/" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Kirby 4</a>, a wonderful file-based CMS, which makes maintaining the site incredibly simple. Although I led the design of the new site, it was very much a collaborative effort with my good friend <a href="https://manuelmoreale.com" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Manu</a>, a wizard when it comes to web dev. With his input and execution, the site's design and performance exceeded my original vision. The result is a timeless web presence, counter to trends, and highly accessible.</p>

            <title>Digital Relationships</title>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>This is my response to Manu's article for the <a href="https://indieweb.org/indieweb-carnival" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">IndieWeb Carnival</a> on <a href="https://manuelmoreale.com/on-digital-relationships" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">digital relationships</a>.</p>
<hr />
<p>As someone who grew up in the 90s, I spent my formative years and much of my teenage years without a screen. I wasn't even much of a gamer as a kid. I would spend as much time as possible outside. Getting up to all kinds of shenanigans in my local village. I had a positive upbringing by most accounts, although I wouldn't say I had many strong relationships.</p>
<p>It wasn't until the Internet became mainstream and a tool to make global connections that I experienced many more interactions on a daily basis. Social interactions that would later evolve into meaningful digital relationships through shared interests that would eventually give me the opportunity to meet people face-to-face. One of those has been with <a href="https://manuelmoreale.com" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Manu</a>. From what started as a work collaboration has evolved into a friendship I value as much as any others I have built offline. Yet not every digital relationship needs to be met with a face for it to be meaningful.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Digital relationships are powerful. Some people discard them because they think they’re not at the same level as “real relationships” but I disagree. Digital relationships are their own thing. They have their own rules, and their own ways to be unique. And they can be as important as any other relationship.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>From the early days of IRC chat rooms, to discussion forums, to random blog-related emails, to working collaborations, I've met some wonderful people born out of digital interactions that would otherwise never have happened if not for the web. The digital relationships that I've formed over the past 20 years have literally taken me around the world, including Italy, France, Germany, the Netherlands, the US and even Hong Kong. It's wild reflecting on it now, but I wouldn't change a thing.</p>
<p>So what of the digital landscape and our connections today? It looks a lot different from the dial-up days of old. Some for the better. Some for the worse. Even how we work has changed significantly with the rise of remote working, which I'm grateful enough to experience today. All my working relationships were born digitally and it works incredibly well. I don't think I could operate as effectively in an alternative environment.</p>
<p>Today, digital relationships are probably more short-lived than ever before. Social media has its benefits, but it's also pretty toxic. It's a challenge to carve out genuine relationships because almost everything digital is built around the notion of speed and convenience. It's a struggle to slow the cadence of the web and our daily social interactions; to avoid becoming over-stimulated the second we wake up in the morning. And it's for this reason I find myself gravitating towards natural activities of the past—without a screen. Albeit with a slightly different landscape and a more focused mindset. </p>
<p>For all the appreciation I have for digital relationships, it's difficult to find the same level of stimulation and fulfilment you experience when in someone's physical presence. I think the key difference is context. Social interactions experienced face-to-face are not only in sync, but share the same space so we can appreciate the nuances of our communication, especially body language. This context apparently triggers the circuits in our brain that are responsible for regulating social homeostasis. </p>
<p>That said, I find it's important to find a balance of both forms of interaction. Ultimately, it boils down to the quality of each individual relationship and what impact a person has on me and I on them, not the means of <em>how</em> we communicate.</p>]]></description>

            <title>Uniform</title>
            <link>https://carlbarenbrug.com/@/page/T6LsTfeuUvVwxDAl</link>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>Ever thought of having a personal uniform? Not the typical work attire, but a carefully curated capsule wardrobe that reflects a cohesive style. My interest in fashion is limited, yet the concept of capsule wardrobes has fascinated me for years. I've been chipping away at crafting my own <a href="https://carlbarenbrug.com/capsule-wardrobe">personal uniform</a> and it's been a gradual process that's been ongoing for over 5 years. So I'd like to dive a little deeper into this topic.</p>
<hr />
<h2>The concept</h2>
<p>A capsule wardrobe is a thoughtfully curated collection of clothing that emphasises quality over quantity. It's about streamlining your wardrobe to a selection of versatile pieces that you truly enjoy and wear regularly. The idea isn’t to limit your options, but to create a more intentional and cohesive wardrobe that reflects your personal style and lifestyle needs. Each item in a capsule wardrobe is chosen for its functionality, comfort, and the ability to mix and match, making getting dressed not just simpler, but a genuine pleasure. It’s about breaking free from the endless cycle of fast and on-trend fashion and embracing a more sustainable, personalised approach to what we wear every day. Here's a sample of my personal inventory:</p>

<h2>My uniform</h2>
<p>Firstly, the palette. I'm personally drawn to shades of black and white, yet, after learning more about <a href="https://theconceptwardrobe.com/colour-analysis-comprehensive-guides/what-is-color-analysis" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">colour analysis</a> I'm not convinced black suits my complexion. Most people don't have a clue what colours and tones suit their skin type, and maybe don't particularly care. We all have undertones, overtones, seasons, and pairing these with fabrics that also suit our facial features is incredibly difficult. Material tones that might suit my skin (probably warm colours), might not be colours I enjoy aesthetically (although accents of yellow could be interesting). I want my uniform to also reflect my personality, not just my skin tone. So I need to consider the details of the fabrics I wear. For instance, faded blacks and off-whites will work better with my complexion than stark black and white. At least, this is the case for upper body fabrics.</p>
<figure class="img-figure with-caption"><div class="img-wrapper" data-tooltip="" style="padding-bottom: 100%"><img alt="" class="img" loading="lazy" src="https://carlbarenbrug.com/media/pages/blog/uniform/0def312245-1708785419/carl-uniform.jpg"></div><figcaption>Out for a walk in sunny Edinburgh</figcaption></figure>
<p>Next, let's talk about style and fit. My personal uniform strikes a balance between utilitarian functionality and comfort, drawing inspiration from the minimalist aesthetics of Japanese streetwear, with a <em>hint</em> of futurism. It comprises a layered ensemble of loose-fitting tees, sweatshirts, jackets, pants, and sneakers — a casual yet distinctive look. While I'm fond of the idea of owning multiple pieces of the same garment for simplicity, I often hesitate, especially when shopping online, due to uncertainties about fit and appearance. Even when a piece does meet my expectations, I usually find that one is enough. Above all, my uniform must be versatile enough to cater to a range of needs, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>day wear for the home</li>
<li>general purpose outdoor wear (all seasons)</li>
<li>event/evening wear</li>
<li>gym wear for weights and cardio</li>
<li>gym wear for climbing</li>
<li>outdoor hiking wear (all seasons)</li>
<li>rare special occasion smart wear</li>
</ul>
<p>These requirements equate to quite a lot of clothing. Probably more than I'd like to have, but I do operate in a <em>one-in-one-out</em> basis, so quantity is never out of control. That said, a good tip is to always store away clothes that are out-of-season. It keeps the clutter to a minimum and your wardrobe rarely feels overwhelming. Although some wardrobe pieces might not remain in my possession for long periods (I often donate), the ones that do are worn into the ground. I don't care if there's holes in my clothes or colours fade. So my clothes are rarely in pristine condition.</p>
<p>Yet the process continues to be challenging. I think my gym wear is what's in need of most refinement. I'm still experimenting with styles, fabrics, and brands, but I'm hoping to settle on a uniform soon. All other areas are taking shape, but again, I might need to tweak the shades of some garments to better suit my skin tone.</p>

<p><em>Update 2025: my uniform basically consists of 2 brands: YZY + Uniqlo</em></p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>Since the relaunch of <a href="https://minimalism.com" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">minimalism.com</a>, where we created a series of technical drawings inspired by some iconic and beautifully designed objects to the homepage modules, I wanted to further explore this line art direction. So I continued my collaboration with <a href="https://instagram.com/kirba.pro" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Bakir Fazlic</a> to produce additional illustrations for an aesthetic and minimal <a href="https://minimalism.com/shop" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">wallpaper pack</a> designed for smartphones.</p>
<p>The pack contains 9 technical drawings of objects that represent our love of minimal design and music. What makes this wallpaper pack extra special is that it comes with a PSD file where in Adobe Photoshop you can customise the size, position, stroke, and background of each design, making the pack highly versatile and personalised to you. But even if you don't have the software to edit them, the standard black and white versions look great. Or you can try using <a href="https://www.photopea.com/" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Photopea</a> (a free browser-based simulation of Photoshop).</p>

            <title>The Value of Being Generic Within a Niche</title>
            <link>https://carlbarenbrug.com/@/page/2B1Brd99lZZnbvP1</link>

            <pubDate>Sun, 01 Mar 2024 00:00:00 +0100</pubDate>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="https://minimalism.com" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Minimalism Life&reg;</a> project, now eight years in the making, began as an experiment. Slowly, we've defined our purpose, gained a respectable readership, acquired valuable assets, and developed a timeless design language. The process hasn't been easy; in fact, it's been bloody challenging, especially considering this is a side project. Yet, I sometimes revisit an important reminder of a very deliberate decision we made at the outset of this venture: our positioning. Specifically, our choice to embrace a generic branding of 'Minimalism' within its own niche.</p>
<p>We were fully aware of the risks involved in choosing such a generic name. Maybe it lacks character. Maybe it's not distinctive. Maybe it's boring. And all that might be true. But we strongly believe in the inherent value of what we've created, a value that isn't dependent on business models, revenue streams, market and societal trends, or even brand reputation. So, let me give you a glimpse into the value of ML®—translucency provided, leaving the financials aside.</p>
<h2>Ownership</h2>
<p>In terms of ownership, we've secured significant assets, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>The company name <em>Minimalism Ltd</em></li>
<li>The registered trademark for <em>Minimalism Life®</em></li>
<li>The domain name <a href="https://minimalism.com" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">minimalism.com</a></li>
<li>The @minimalism handle on over 30 social media platforms, including:<ul>
<li>X/Twitter</li>
<li>Facebook</li>
<li>TikTok</li>
<li>YouTube</li>
<li>Pinterest</li>
<li>Telegram</li>
<li>Vimeo</li>
<li>Tumblr</li>
<li>LinkedIn</li>
<li>Medium</li>
<li>Unsplash</li>
<li>Slack</li>
<li>Linktree</li>
<li>OnlyFans</li>
<li>Patreon</li>
<li>Substack</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The @minimalismlife handle on Instagram + Threads</li>
<li>A combined social following of over 500,000</li>
<li>More than 36,000 newsletter subscribers</li>
</ul>
<h2>Value</h2>
<p>The collective value of these assets is considerable (even if I have personal concerns with social media). Our domain name alone holds potential six-figure value in the current market for generic single-word <em>.com</em> domains. The fact we've also secured key usernames across the largest social networks further amplifies the company's value. Not to mention our readership numbers.</p>
<p>Together, these achievements not only highlight our current success with the project, but also underscore its potential for future growth or redirection (or even acquisition). The generic yet focused nature of our brand provides a versatile foundation for exploration within the minimalism spectrum, embodying the very essence of opportunity and flexibility. And therein lies the beauty and value.</p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>It's Good Friday. 7AM. I don't particularly care about the significance of today, but it's a bank holiday and I've got the day off work, but instead of having a relaxing morning, I hit the gym for an early session. Energised by the sunrise of a beautiful spring day, I decide to do something a little different. I say to myself that after this workout, I'm going to treat myself to the simple pleasure of an indulgent breakfast at a local Edinburgh bistro (<a href="https://toastleith.co.uk/" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Toast</a>) I've enjoyed in the past.</p>
<p>After a fairly satisfying training session at the gym where I also finished listening to the audiobook <a href="https://literal.club/book/the-school-of-life-calm-kf3hm" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>Calm</em> by The School of Life</a>, I make my way to the bistro. I sit on a stool facing out to the waters of Leith. The sun is still shining and the water is still. It's a beautiful spot. I browse the menu while listening to a soothing jazz playlist and order avocados on toast with a couple of poached eggs and smoked bacon, with a coffee. Very hipster, I know, but so what? As I look out, I see several ducks pottering about on a fallen tree in the water, while another relentlessly nose dives to scour what lies beneath the surface. I smile as I watch this duck repeat the process over and over sticking its butt in the air each time it takes the plunge.</p>
<p>I look around a little more and notice three elderly people practicing Tai Chi in a park in the distance. The movement draws me in to an almost hypnotic state. I sit and admire the repetitive nature of the smooth and controlled movements while appreciating the required focus likely needed. I think to myself how much I might enjoy practicing this too.</p>
<p>I look further down the shore and notice a man sitting on the edge, his feet dangling just above the water. Beside him is his little dog sitting completely at ease until he catches a glimpse of his owner opening a sandwich. The man pets his dog and it again falls into a relaxed state as two swans slowly swim by. Everything feels at ease in one sense or another. My phone remains in my pocket, I wait patiently for my breakfast as I sip my coffee, and take a moment to appreciate the pace of the day.</p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>For the longest time, I’ve shared my work through blog posts or social media, rather than having a typical portfolio. But I’ve decided it’s time to pull together a more cohesive collection of my work, focusing on product design and creative direction. My projects are usually long-term endeavours. Although I'm happy to make time for the occasional freelance project, I tend to focus my attention on work I can iterate, refine, and evolve over time.</p>

            <title>What makes tech fun?</title>

            <guid isPermaLink="false">blog/fun-tech</guid>
            <pubDate>Sat, 07 Jun 2024 00:00:00 +0200</pubDate>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>When asking this question, I'm not really thinking too literally. For instance, I'm not asking, "what is a fun piece of tech?" Because the answer to that would be simple: any game, gaming device, or immersive VR experience that's engineered to be fun to use. That's far too simplistic. I'm curious about what gives tech a fun personality without it being a complete waste of time, energy, and resources.</p>
<p>A tech company I've come to quietly admire in recent years is <a href="https://nothing.tech/" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Nothing</a>. Principally an Android phone company building their own hardware devices (with <a href="https://teenage.engineering/" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Teenage Engineering</a>) and software experiences to support those devices, their goal is to <em>make tech fun again.</em> It's a subjective, ambiguous, but bold concept to design from. I mean, Apple had an advertising campaign with the slogan <em>think different.</em> This slogan has long outlived that particular campaign period from the late 90s, which I believe was a response to IBM at the time. But Apple fully embraced this approach with their product line and it clearly worked wonders for them. Because it wasn't just an empty statement. It was embedded in everything they did. They thought different. They made different. And here is Nothing, probably making their own response to Apple and other large tech corporations that seem to be doing the same thing year on year; focusing on financial growth, with few signs of innovation.</p>
<p>I'll leave it up to you to determine whether Nothing's product line is injecting fun into the industry or not. In my opinion, they're working hard to achieve it; they listen to and engage well with their community, while producing good and distinctive design at a relatively decent pace (and price). I enjoy Nothing's design language a lot; it's minimal yet they're not afraid to create something experimental that evokes playfulness or provokes discussion. Like with every brand, however, some products hit better than others, but I guess that comes with the territory with VC-funded startups. I just hope the pressures of funding and profit don’t make them fall in line and start doing what everyone else does. Regardless of what they're making, Nothing's slogan got me thinking.</p>
<hr />
<h2>What makes tech fun? (from my design perspective)</h2>

<h2>What sucks the fun out of tech? (for everyone)</h2>
<p>In a word: growth; infinite growth that's impossible to achieve. Yet major tech companies (including some gaming cos) chase this impossibility relentlessly and unashamedly. If all you're seeking is exponential profit margins, then all you'll do is maintain the status quo, be guided by trends, make more of what sells, do what's expected, and do what customers tell you to do. This kills innovation.</p>
<p>Fun tech isn't always good tech (at least in the sense of design standards), but it's something designers and engineers need to make, and something consumers need to experience.</p>]]></description>

            <title>Taste</title>
            <link>https://carlbarenbrug.com/@/page/5cYCsnbJSxtsBHgG</link>
            <guid isPermaLink="false">blog/taste</guid>
            <pubDate>Sun, 01 Aug 2024 00:00:00 +0200</pubDate>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>We need good taste to make good things, but we must first qualify and understand what <em>good</em> means in the sense of design.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Taste is the ability to identify quality. To understand quality we need to look critically at: materials that are fit for purpose, ergonomics that considers audience needs, effective use of affordances, usability, accessibility, harmonic colour choices, aesthetic choices that elicit emotion, intentional visual hierarchy — amongst others. Taste is in the observer, quality is in the object. The concept of taste becomes more productive when framed objectively around quality, and in ways that are measurable or at least comparable.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That's an excerpt from a wonderfully written piece by <a href="https://www.doc.cc/articles/taste" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">DOC</a>, which prompted me to dive a little deeper into the subjectivity and objectivity of <em>taste</em> in design. It's a topic that's been explained by <a href="https://www.paulgraham.com/taste.html" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Paul Graham</a>, going in to great depth about what constitutes good design. Give it a read. Since digesting Paul's perspective, I want to focus on how we can communicate the meaning of taste without it being treated as an undervalued, airy abstraction during the design process.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If taste is just personal preference, then everyone's taste is already perfect: you like whatever you like, and that's it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Not that taste is devoid of personal preference. That preference, however, is strongly supported by your experience in your field and abiding by certain design principles. It's supported by trial and error, successes, mistakes, experiments, people, and technology. And it's supported by the vision and intent you have as a designer.</p>
<p>Taste is learned over time through production, iteration, feeling. And we should always feel our way through a design process — not hold ourselves hostage to best practices, however well-intentioned those might be. Why? Because we're human. And that's what we design for. That comes with predictability as much unpredictability. We can never be certain that proposed solutions are the right solutions. But therein lies the challenge, and at times, fun of design.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The growth of taste is a conscious attempt at originality.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Great work comes from having high standards, knowing your field well, and continuously striving to improve things that don’t meet those standards. And with each project, we sharpen those tools. We copy less. We read more. We listen intently.</p>
<p>Taste often needs to be convincing before it reaches production. But it's not like taste is a single thing that stands out from other elements of your work. It's your collective vision and execution of a design. Taste is just a label we give to symbolise originality.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Communicating to others</h2>
<p>Communicating your taste can be challenging, though. It's not a concept that's easily articulated, especially to those who aren't as versed in design principles. Empathy probably goes a long way in understanding what others value so you can frame how taste can be discussed, and therefore, how it resonates. And it might depend on who you need to convince. Consumers? Colleagues? Peers? Project managers? I'd like to say it's only the end user, but that's not always the case. A few things can be done during the design process as practical strategies that help express to audiences what taste means.</p>
<p><strong>Colleagues:</strong> establish a shared language and visual references with mood boards or style guides that showcase the aesthetic you're aiming for. These can include colour schemes, typography, textures, and inspirational designs. When everyone on the team has a visual reference, it's easier to align on what constitutes good taste. Look at successful designs within your industry or even outside it. Discuss what makes them effective and how they embody good taste. This helps create a common benchmark for quality.</p>
<p><strong>Project managers:</strong> link design decisions to business objectives by explaining how good design leads to brand recognition, customer loyalty, and overall market competitiveness. Taste in design isn't just an artistic preference but a strategic choice. You can also explain how your design choices meet user needs, enhance user experience, or solve specific problems.</p>
<p><strong>Consumers:</strong> create a consistent and engaging brand experience that tells a story. Whether it's through the use of specific colours, fonts, or imagery, each element should contribute to the narrative that aligns with your brand values and appeals to your audience's emotions. Ensure that all elements of your design — from packaging to site to social media — are consistent in style, tone, and quality. This builds trust and loyalty.</p>
<hr />
<p>Reflecting on your own work, what does good taste mean to you? Do you think it's learned and developed or something certain people naturally possess?</p>]]></description>

            <title>Rituals</title>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>Ritual, <em>a sequence of activities involving gestures, words, actions, or revered objects.</em></p>
<p>When you hear this word, where does your mind take you? For me, I find myself asking, what's the difference between a ritual and routine? Turns out that, in essence, routines are practical, while rituals are meaningful. I have both. Some casual and spontaneous, and others strict and frequent. I do enjoy structure and rhythm, and it's really the only way for me to maintain a disciplined lifestyle. That's not to say it lacks adventure and random acts. I do my best to make time and space for these things.</p>
<p>Some rituals hold more meaning than others, and I currently experience several in my own life. I'd love to experience more, honestly, such as meditation, tea ceremonies, health retreats, or hiking adventures, but like with everything in life, rituals come and go as we live through our many chapters.</p>
<p>Although I wouldn't call any of my rituals symbolic, they do tend to hold a deep sense of significance and purpose for me. For instance, rock climbing outdoors. There's the preparation, the focus, the physical challenge, and the connection with nature — it all adds layers of meaning to the activity. For me, it's not just about the physical act but also about problem solving, pushing personal boundaries, and even connecting with the environment. Even better if I can do this with a group of friends. Those elements turn it into something more than just a routine workout. I have a connected and emerging ritual off the back of this too; a particular circle of friends plan an annual climbing trip abroad every year. We've done it for the past couple of years, so it's pretty new, but we're already planning next year's adventure. It's a special time that's really enriched my life. Long may it continue.</p>
<p>Another, albeit lesser, ritual for me would be the act of coffee making. You won't find me with a Nespresso machine, by the way. The simple, repeated actions of grinding beans, brewing, and savouring that first sip with a little square of dark chocolate can become a mindful moment, giving me space to pause and enjoy something familiar and comforting. It's such a small and simple pleasure, but one I really enjoy. Get yourself a coffee machine for the home. It's the best investment you can make.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>Sometimes things need to end so we can create something new. Essentially, what's ending is <a href="https://minimalissimo.com" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Minimalissimo</a>, and what's beginning is a creative lab I’ve named <a href="https://formfeelingfunction.com" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">FFF</a>. I feel like I've done my part in curating beautiful minimalism on the web over the past 12+ years. Now, I’m ready to shift gears — from curating to creating minimalist products of my own. These will be both digital and physical, made in collaboration with <a href="https://manuelmoreale.com" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Manu</a>. We'll also be offering web services tailored to architects and interior designers.</p>
<p>The basic idea behind <a href="https://formfeelingfunction.com" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">FFF</a> is to make things we like, with taste, simplicity, and purpose. Everything is experimental, which means failure isn't a concern — only learning, refining, and iterating. We're not in this for growth; we're in it for the love of creation, for fun, and for making useful things. Where that journey takes us? Well, we'll see.</p>
<p>We'll explain the concept, principles, and philosophy behind FFF when we launch the next iteration of the site.</p>
<p>Work starts in 2025. In the meantime, go ahead and bookmark <a href="https://formfeelingfunction.com" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">formfeelingfunction.com</a></p>]]></description>

            <title>15 Years of Loving Curation</title>
            <link>https://carlbarenbrug.com/@/page/y42ImPTgsAw9NpMu</link>
            <guid isPermaLink="false">blog/15-years-of-loving-curation</guid>
            <pubDate>Mon, 02 Oct 2024 00:00:00 +0200</pubDate>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>In my <a href="https://carlbarenbrug.com/blog/formfeelingfunction">previous post</a>, I mentioned that <a href="https://minimalissimo.com" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Minimalissimo</a> was coming to an end and that I'd be embarking on a new adventure with <a href="https://formfeelingfunction.com" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">FormFeelingFunction&reg;</a>. Well, I think it's worth explaining the site's journey, impact, and inevitable sunset. Because it has played a significant role in my life for well over a decade and deserves a few words to bring this story some closure.</p>
<p>Back in 2009, the world was emerging from a massive recession and people were looking to simplify their lives. This introduced a natural draw towards minimalism. Not just as a lifestyle choice, but as a way to shape physical environments and products. This movement led to the birth of Minimalissimo as one of the original blogs to showcase and celebrate minimal design. There were far fewer design blogs around in those days, especially ones focused on the niche of minimalism. But readership slowly grew, as did the number of voluntary editors of the site. And so, as an avid reader myself, I volunteered to research and share my findings across the web. Turns out, I was pretty good at this, and from 2012, I essentially led our small team to push the standards of design curation.</p>
<p>Between 2011 and 2015, <a href="https://minimalissimo.com" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">minimalissimo.com</a> was undoubtedly the most read and respected minimal design blog on the web. Sure, there were other massive publications that dwarfed our little site, but within our niche, no site offered the same level of consistent quality in curation. We were easily hitting over 100k unique visits to the site per month. At this point, we had accumulated over 6 years of posts spanning a wide variety of art, architecture, and design, so it felt like a natural step to evolve Minimalissimo into both a printed and digital publication. Particularly as print was thriving at the time. This then led to a trio of self-published magazines that each sold incredibly well. I'm still massively proud of those volumes and you can still get your hands on the <a href="https://minimalissimo.shop" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">digital versions</a> today.</p>
<p>Our work in print design led to collaborative opportunities and so we ventured into more areas of product design. We made a limited edition timepiece with <a href="https://www.hodina.co" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">HODINA</a>. We made a split-fountain diptych print series with <a href="https://bergerfohr.com" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Berger &amp; F&ouml;hr</a>. We also collaborated with <a href="https://www.studiolenzing.com" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Studio Lenzing</a> to create elegant wallpaper and icon sets — all fun projects driven by a shared love of minimalism. These projects were made with care and never treated as revenue generators. Yes, all projects were profitable, but none of them blew up. But that's OK. Our output was still something to be extremely proud of.</p>
<p>By 2019, the volume of design blogs and magazines on the web was huge. Many began to look the same and we began to notice so much recycled content. Curation was becoming increasingly challenging if we wanted to maintain distinctiveness. On top of this, social media was very quickly eating away at indie websites like a plague. Our readership was declining year after year, and the pressures of pumping more energy into social media platforms to be noticed and relevant was a huge time sink. And it stunk. Much like the algorithms we'd all have to navigate in the years that followed. We were fighting a losing battle.</p>
<p>So in recent years, I began working a lot more with <a href="https://manuelmoreale.com" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Manu Moreale</a>. Together, we decided to defy trends, experiment where possible, and focus on what we could control. We crafted various iterations of the website, trying various methods of how readers would engage with the site. We also experimented with a lot of monetisation strategies, including memberships, donations, unobtrusive ads, shop promotions, and so on. Some worked, some didn't. But fuck it, we tried. And we enjoyed the ride and the connections we made along the way.</p>
<p>Ultimately, we feel we've respectfully given enough to the web, dedicating 15 years to it. But all labours of love come to an end eventually. It's actually mad to think how long this thing lasted. So although our curation ends here, the website will continue to exist as a digital archive. Which means you can still enjoy and discover beautiful minimalism from thousands of artists and designers.</p>
<p>For the time being, we'll continue publishing a monthly newsletter, so <a href="https://buttondown.com/minimalissimo" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">please subscribe</a> to that if you still want to see what we find on the web.</p>
<p>To all our Minimalissimo readers; thank you for stopping by.</p>
<p><em>Note: If you so happen to be interested in acquiring Minimalissimo, I'm open to selling it. Just email me to discuss.</em></p>
<p><em>Update: I have found a buyer for Minimalissimo, so I proudly hand over this wonderful project from July 2025.</em></p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>Lately, I've been thinking about my inner compass — the one that guides me through work and daily life. I've touched on my <a href="https://carlbarenbrug.com/design-ethos">design ethos</a> before, but this feels like something more personal. It's a lightweight breakdown of who I am, both as a designer and a human, shaped by the values, mantras, principles, people, and quotes that influence what I create and how I try to live. But consider this compass a living thing — subject to change always and forever.</p>

<h2>Quotes in design</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>"Design is not the act of amazing an audience with the novelty of forms or materials; it is the originality that repeatedly extracts astounding ideas from the crevices of the very commonness of everyday life." – Kenya Hara</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>"True design lies in a realm counter to trends." – Sori Yanagi</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>"Good design is a matter of discipline. It starts by looking at the problem and collecting all the available information about it. If you understand the problem, you have the solution. It's really more about logic than imagination." – Massimo Vignelli</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>"Things get more refined as you make mistakes. I've had a chance to make a lot of mistakes. Your aesthetics get better as you make mistakes. But the real big thing is: if you're going to make something, it doesn't take any more energy—and rarely does it take more money—to make it really great. All it takes is a little more time. And a willingness to do so, a willingness to persevere until it's really great." – Steve Jobs</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>"Minimalism is not a style, it is an attitude, a way of being. It's a fundamental reaction against noise, visual noise, disorder, vulgarity. Minimalism is the pursuit of the essence of things, not the appearance." – Claudio Silvestrin</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>"We need to aim at essential things, removing every redundant effect, every useless flowering. Elaborating a concept on mathematical bases, on fundamental ideas, on elementary structures. We strongly need to avoid waste and excess." – A G Fronzoni</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>"A designer who wants to achieve good design must not regard himself as an artist who, according to taste and aesthetics, is merely dressing up products with a last-minute garment. The designer must be the creative engineer. They synthesise the completed product from the various elements that make up its design. Their work is largely rational, meaning that aesthetic decisions are justified by an understanding of the product’s purpose." – Dieter Rams</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Quotes in life</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>"One day or day one. You decide." – The Minimalists</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>"I do believe that you don't need more than is essential, and that is hard to define. It depends on how you live — you need a certain amount of things for life to go smoothly, though if you have more than you need it gets in the way." – John Pawson</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>"There's an infinite amount of materials with which to build our lives — but sometimes the best way to build is to subtract." – Joshua Fields Millburn</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>"Structure isn't a rule — it's a rhythm." – The Minimalists</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>"Don't use an excuse for every stupid thing. There is not too short, too tall, too heavy, too warm, too wet, too humid. There is just one excuse: too weak. So don't use excuses, try harder." – Alexander Megos</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>"Successful communication depends on how well we listen, rather than how well we push our opinions on the person seated before us." – Kenya Hara</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>As the year draws to a close with gloomy December days compensated with lots of artificial lighting, it's not surprising that many people take the time to reflect on their recent past — what we've managed to achieve, what we learned, what we failed in, where we went, and what we experienced. Did you take steps forward this year — or even strides? Did you regress? What did you get up to? I'm genuinely curious, so feel free to <a href="mailto:&#99;&#97;&#x72;&#108;&#64;&#109;&#x69;&#x6e;&#105;&#x6d;&#97;&#x6c;&#x69;&#x73;&#109;&#x2e;&#x63;&#x6f;&#x6d;">email me</a>.</p>
<p>For me, it was a positive, albeit unspectacular, year — one I'm very grateful for. I'd like to share some highs and a few lows with you before I begin to focus on the year ahead.</p>
<ul>
<li>I visited Iceland for the first time, explored incredible landscapes, and soaked in the hot springs.</li>
<li>I travelled to Trentino in northern Italy with a small group of friends where we climbed, dined, and yapped under the sun.</li>
<li>I visited Mallorca with my partner for a very relaxing trip on a beautiful island.</li>
<li>I saw the aurora borealis for the first time, which happened to be in my home city (and not Iceland).</li>
<li>I made a small breakthrough with my climbing by sending my first 7A+/V7 boulder.</li>
<li><a href="https://099.supply" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">099 SPLY</a> had its best year to date in terms of sales and product releases.</li>
<li>I received a double digit pay rise.</li>
<li>I made a decent profit when I sold my Bitcoin.</li>
<li>I saw friends thrive.</li>
<li>My grandmother turned 95.</li>
<li>I archived <a href="https://minimalissimo.com" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Minimalissimo&reg;</a> (not sure if this is a good or bad thing — but it's an end of an era).</li>
<li>I missed out on several career opportunities.</li>
<li>I caught myself comparing my progress to others too often — something I'm working on.</li>
<li>I started a new creative lab named <a href="https://formfeelingfunction.com" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">FormFeelingFunction&reg;</a>.</li>
<li>I became an uncle for the second time (hello, Kobi).</li>
<li>I started learning to swim properly (and I'm still trying!).</li>
</ul>
<p>Looking back, I've realised it's often the small successes and simple joys that stick: travelling, family milestones, or breakthroughs in climbing and swimming. Next year, I'm hoping to focus more on those types of moments, evolve my design career, and worry less about the comparisons.</p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>I've been mulling over my presence on social media for a while now. There's only three platforms I actively use, but honestly, it feels like there should only be one — and that one, <a href="https://www.are.na" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Are.na</a>, breaks the mould of a typical social media space. You can find me on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/barenbrug/" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Instagram</a>, <a href="https://x.com/carlbarenbrug" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">X</a>, and <a href="https://www.are.na/carl-barenbrug/" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Are.na</a>.</p>
<p>My excuses for sticking around on the first two are pretty weak. Instagram is where I have the most personal connections, but those connections would probably survive just fine if I stepped away. Mostly, it's a massive distraction and a bit of a time sink. X (Twitter), on the other hand, has always been more of a professional tool to connect with the design industry. But lately, it's become less inspiring and more of a chore: endless political noise courtesy of Elon, generic web and SaaS trends that are neither original nor distinctive, AI this, AI that, and product designers churning out the same formula — Figma, React, dark mode, gradients, neon colours, animations, animations, and more animations. And then there's the onchain chatter, which tries so very hard to sound revolutionary and edgy. That said, I'm not writing off the onchain space just yet (hello, <a href="https://rodeo.club/@barenbrug/" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Rodeo</a>); I'm just unconvinced by, well, a lot of it.</p>
<p>OK, X rant over. Safe to say, I should probably leave that place sooner rather than later.</p>
<p>That leaves me with <a href="https://www.are.na" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Are.na</a> — the best place on the internet today. Sure, there's other tools that let you save and organise content, but Are.na hits different. It has character, a good energy, and feels like a mindful space brimming with creativity that inspires me every single day. It feeds my research and design over time, and connects me with people, ideas, and knowledge from often-overlooked corners of the web that I can then collect either privately or publicly. Even if I check the site multiple times a day, there might only be a few new things for me to discover in my feed, but I can be led down a rabbit hole just the same — it's full of surprises.</p>
<p>I love that Are.na has no algorithms and no incentive to post anything other than what you genuinely want to save to a channel. It could be a fleeting thought, an idea you're circling, something you've made yourself, a useful tool, a website that's been nicely designed, or a product you've wish-listed. There's no ego and no dopamine hit encouraged by other socials. It's just about unobtrusively sharing good stuff with structure, devoid of noise you can't control. And because it's strongly supported by its community, Are.na feels like it's here to stay — free from pandering to money-hungry goblins.</p>
<p>Here's to channel-hopping.</p>]]></description>

            <title>The Social Media Mirage</title>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>Once upon a time, the power of a strong social media following could make a career. It still can, of course, but to a much, much lesser extent. I won't bore you with a recycled narrative of the shitty algorithm effect, although relevant in this case. Suffice to say, a follow count is only worth a fraction of what is portrayed—especially today. This is down to visibility in feed (or lack thereof), attention diversity, content delivery type, output frequency, and the need to constantly adapt to platform trends.</p>
<p>When once a following of 10,000 could turn your life around with organic reach, today a following of 100,000 barely even makes a dent in the pursuit of success. Obviously you can take this with a pinch of salt, as subject matters vary widely—commercialism vs. the arts vs. social and societal endeavours. But there are dark arts you can master if you're armed with the right knowledge, time, money, and commitment—such as engagement hacking, ad spending, and algo manipulation. Problem is, most people don't have that armoury or budget to experiment because social media is considered a supplementary ingredient to their work. So if social followers and gatekeeper platforms are unreliable, what’s the alternative? The answer lies in building something more direct—where your audience isn't at the mercy of ever-changing platform rules.</p>
<p>The humble email. The most underrated, yet most reliable way to reach an audience—through the direct, unfiltered power of a newsletter. No interference, no restrictions, no risk of vanishing from their feed. Sure, there's always a chance of landing in a junk folder—but if someone subscribed intentionally, you're already miles ahead of fighting for visibility in a cluttered feed.</p>
<p>An email list grows slowly, but it's built to last. Unlike social platforms, where a tweak in the algorithm can wipe out years of effort, your email list is yours. Even if you switch newsletter providers, you can take your entire audience with you—no loss, no setback. And I'd take one engaged email subscriber over 100 passive social followers any day.</p>
<p>I know this isn't some revolutionary take—it's just a gentle reminder that your value isn't measured by follower counts or social media engagement. Platforms come and go, algos shift overnight, and attention is more fragmented than ever. But what remains consistent? Email. And there's a lot to love about it.</p>
<p>It's focused, distraction-free, and completely yours to shape however you want. Whether it's a single plain-text paragraph or a visually rich marketing campaign, you have full editorial control.</p>
<p>And if email isn't your thing? Newsletters can also be followed via RSS, making them even more accessible to those who prefer an open-web, no-inbox approach.</p>
<p>If you're curious to see this in action, I'm experimenting with my new project <a href="https://formfeelingfunction.com" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">FFF&reg;</a>. I don't even know what it's going to include yet, but you can nevertheless subscribe here: <a href="https://buttondown.com/fff" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">buttondown.com/fff</a></p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>The little creative lab I run with Manu, <a href="https://formfeelingfunction.com" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">FormFeelingFunction&reg;</a>, is starting to take shape — albeit slowly. We’ve been mulling over all sorts of concepts. Some might be realised, some probably won’t, and a few definitely will. One that’s just gone live is our most experimental idea yet: a private audio guestbook.</p>
<figure class="img-figure with-caption"><div class="img-wrapper" data-tooltip="" style="padding-bottom: 100%"><img alt="" class="img" loading="lazy" src="https://carlbarenbrug.com/media/pages/blog/audio-guestbook/3e30a92a63-1750756799/fff-voicenote.jpg"></div><figcaption>Record a private voice note</figcaption></figure>
<p>It’s simple. You can leave us an anonymous voice note, up to 15 seconds long. Say whatever you want. It won’t be shared. It’s just for our ears.</p>
<p>We’re curious what kind of messages people will leave when there’s no public stage. Does knowing it’s private change what you share? Will it bring out something playful, serious, weird, or surprising? That’s the fun of it.</p>
<p>You can add your email if you want a reply, but you don’t have to. There are no rules here. We’ll keep the guestbook open for a while and see how it goes — it might become a permanent fixture, or we’ll open it only at certain times of the year. Time will tell. We’ll probably blog about what we learn, too.</p>
<p>So go ahead and drop us a voice note at <a href="https://formfeelingfunction.com" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">formfeelingfunction.com</a></p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>I think it's been about three years since I last updated my desk setup. But I recently made some changes, which I'd like to share with you. The overall dark vibe of my previous setup has remained, but I've upgraded a few elements. See my <a href="https://carlbarenbrug.com/blog/workspace-revisited-2022">2022 workspace setup</a> if you're curious.</p>
<figure class="img-figure"><div class="img-wrapper" data-tooltip="minimal desk setup with keyboard, laptop, monitor, and trays" style="padding-bottom: 125%"><img alt="minimal desk setup with keyboard, laptop, monitor, and trays" class="img" loading="lazy" src="https://carlbarenbrug.com/media/pages/blog/workspace-setup-2025/718edda4e6-1754157671/desk-details.jpg"></div></figure>

<h2>The physical desk</h2>
<p>Unlike my previous desk from L&amp;Z Elements, my new desk was far simpler to source. It's the MITTZON adjustable standing desk from IKEA. I've wanted a standing desk for a long time, and most of them look the same, so I thought I'd just go with an affordable option that does the job well and invest more into other things. And the desk is actually decent. Admittedly, the finish of the tabletop is not at the same level as the L&amp;Z Sinus table, but it's far more practical for me. And it's bigger, so it feels really spacious. I continued the black aesthetic because I think it contrasts really well with some of the metallic accessories I have yet blends well with others.</p>
<h2>On desk setup</h2>
<ul>
<li>Apple M1 MacBook Air</li>
<li>Apple Studio Display (tilt only)</li>
<li>Apple Magic Mouse</li>
<li>Apple Magic Keyboard</li>
<li>IKEA desk mat</li>
<li>FFF 3D-printed magnetic logo (<a href="https://formfeelingfunction.com" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">visit the lab</a>)</li>
<li>55-66-88 phone stand by CW&amp;T</li>
<li>L&amp;Z Elements pen tray</li>
<li>L&amp;Z Elements paper tray</li>
<li>Minimalux travel pen</li>
<li>MUJI notebook (blank)</li>
<li>MUJI sketching pen</li>
<li>Microsoft Surface Headphones 2</li>
<li>Hue lamp</li>
</ul>
<p>As for my desk chair, I'm still using the Physix Studio by Vitra, which I've been using for the past few years. Still holds up well.</p>
<hr />
<h2>The virtual desk</h2>
<p>As always, my app dock is hidden by default and only pops up on mouse hover. This helps me focus better. The apps I use on the daily haven't changed much either. Typically, I'll use:</p>
<ul>
<li>Safari for browsing</li>
<li>ChatGPT for general purpose discussion</li>
<li>iA Writer for to-do lists, writing, and notes</li>
<li>Dropbox + Paper for file storage and documentation</li>
<li>Mac Mail for email (<a href="https://carlbarenbrug.com/blog/minimal-email-setup">see my config</a>)</li>
<li>Photoshop for photo editing</li>
<li>Figma for designing</li>
<li>Telegram + Slack for comms</li>
<li>Transmit for FTP client</li>
<li>GitHub for repos</li>
<li>Visual Studio Code for coding</li>
<li>Are.na for R&amp;D</li>
</ul>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>This is an evolved thought of my post about <a href="https://carlbarenbrug.com/blog/my-favourite-designers">my favourite designers ever</a>.</p>
<p>Since I opened my creative lab <a href="https://formfeelingfunction.com" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">FormFeelingFunction&reg;</a>, I’ve also opened my mind to connecting with more creative people. The reason is simple: to make unexpected objects in both digital and analogue form through pure, unadulterated collaboration. So I’ve decided to create an ever-growing and probably optimistic list — one I’ll return to and update over time. And if you happen to be one of the following people, I’d love to <a href="mailto:&#x63;&#x61;&#114;&#108;&#64;&#109;&#x69;&#110;&#x69;&#x6d;&#97;&#108;&#105;&#115;&#x6d;&#x2e;&#99;&#111;&#109;">hear from you</a>.</p>
<p>What will we make together? There’s no creative limits, but I’m particularly interested in homewares, apparel, fashion accessories, single-purpose tools, web apps, and generative art.</p>
<h2>People</h2>
<ul>
<li>James Hicks</li>
<li>Tobias van Schneider</li>
<li>Blank Resident</li>
<li>Jon-Kyle Mohr</li>
<li>Hannes Unt</li>
<li>Malte Müller</li>

<li>Che-Wei Wang + Taylor Levy</li>
</ul>
<p>more to come...</p>

<p>The outline is done. The foundation is built. The potential is huge. I’m looking for the right product person to get involved long term, whether from a marketing or industrial background. 2026 is when it begins. 2027 is when it thrives.</p>
<hr />
<p>UPDATE: I found someone to join the project! Just so happens to be one of <a href="https://carlbarenbrug.com/blog/my-favourite-designers">my favourite designers ever</a>. Announcement will be made end of 2025.</p>]]></description>

            <title>Why Taste Matters More</title>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>Us designers love to talk about tools, processes, and skills. <span style="white-space: pre">We debate</span> software, trade shortcuts, and show off case studies filled with research frameworks and clever flows. All useful things. But what rarely gets talked about and showcased in portfolios is the one thing that actually makes a designer memorable: <em>taste</em>.</p>
<p>Taste gives you vision. It’s the lens through which you decide what matters, and just as importantly, what doesn’t. Without taste, design drifts into decoration or efficiency for efficiency’s sake. Devoid of feeling. With taste, you can see a brand clearly before it even exists, and then pull every detail into alignment.</p>
<p>Experience, on the other hand, is efficiency. It helps you ship faster, avoid mistakes, and manage the moving parts of projects. That’s valuable—but it doesn’t set direction. Being efficient without vision is like being a fast runner with no idea where the finish line is.</p>
<p>Knowledge gives you action. It’s the “how” of design—which fonts pair well, how to structure a layout, how to make a system hold together. But knowledge today is abundant. AI can surface it instantly, and a quick search can hand you the answer. Knowledge shouldn’t be taken for granted, but it’s no longer scarce.</p>
<p>Taste, though, is scarce. It can’t be automated, shortcut, or outsourced. It’s cultivated over years of looking, editing, comparing, curating. It’s what lets you create not just a good design, but a point of view. Luxury is born from that kind of consistency of taste—not from expensive materials, but from every detail feeling inevitable across every channel.</p>
<p>Of course, a strong career blends all three. Taste gives vision. Experience gives efficiency. Knowledge gives action. But if you had to choose just one, taste is the irreplaceable part. For me, this is particularly important when deciding who to hire or collaborate with.</p>
<p>In a world where AI can replicate knowledge and experience can be hired, taste is what actually sets you apart. Cohesion, distinction, character—it all flows downstream from taste.</p>]]></description>

            <title>When QA is Kaput</title>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>Not so long ago, Apple built its reputation on a simple promise: <em>it just works.</em> Today, it feels very different. Their latest OS releases, complete with the highly accessible molten glass UI for both Mac and iPhone, were shipped with unforgivable UI and UX bugs. With thousands of engineers, designers, and testers on a single product, you have to wonder — how are these not seen? What are all those people doing if not ensuring the basics work smoothly? I’m all for the notion of, “If it doesn’t ship, it doesn’t exist.” But shipping should never come at the expense of standards.</p>
<p>This isn’t just an Apple problem. Across the tech industry (especially SaaS), when companies face financial cuts, one of the first casualties is often the QA (Quality Assurance) team. Testing is absorbed by engineers, who already struggle with the demands of building features at speed. It’ll come as no shock that quality suffers. Products are pushed out with half-assed functionality, broken flows, unintuitive gestures, or regressions that frustrate the very people they’re meant to serve. Ultimately, trust suffers.</p>
<p>The irony is that small, non–VC-funded startups, who could be forgiven for missing a detail or two, often show more care than the giants. They have limited resources, yet often manage to get the mechanics right. Meanwhile, the companies with every resource at their disposal ship shitty software and shrug it off as iteration.</p>
<p>At the root of this is culture. VC-backed companies are told to ship at warp speed. Deadlines and growth matter more than refinement or stability. Engineers aren’t rewarded for preventing bugs; they’re rewarded for releasing feature upon feature. And design teams are caught in the same cycle: polish is a luxury, not a requirement. But I suppose when there’s little consequence, why care about first impressions at all?</p>
<p>Care has quietly slipped out of the holistic design process. The patience to test thoroughly, the pride in details, the discipline to say “not yet” or even ask “is this better than it was?” — these values are hard to find in a field of slop. The result is a landscape where even the biggest players can’t be trusted to release a stable product.</p>
<p>In a culture obsessed with speed, the real challenge isn’t how fast you can ship, but whether you can still ship with care and stay relevant.</p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>I’ve always appreciated the word <em>blog</em>. It feels honest and informal; a small, functional word from the early web. Blogs were, and still are, places to share links, notes, ideas, and to find others doing the same. That spirit of exchange still matters. [<a href="https://blogroll.org" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">See blogroll.org</a>]</p>
<p>Lately I’ve been thinking about what it means to write on a personal site. Not as performance or publishing schedule, but as a way of keeping something. The internet moves quickly; memory does not. So instead of thinking of this site as a blog, I want to reframe it as a <em>memory</em> space. Not in name, but in spirit.</p>
<p>A blog documents what’s new; a memory holds what endures. Much of what I share is still in progress — projects, experiments, thoughts — but I like the idea that it all becomes part of a lasting digital archive. A self-contained record that lives here, not buried in the feeds or vaults of social media.</p>
<p>This shift isn’t about nostalgia for old internet habits, though there’s affection there. It’s about recognising that writing online can be quieter, slower, more intentional. I don’t need to publish to perform. I just want to build a body of work that remembers where it came from.</p>
<p>Each entry here is an act of keeping — something read, seen, built, or felt. Some memories are full essays; others are fragments. Together they form an archive of attention; not a timeline but a trace.</p>
<p>Call it whatever you want; a memory, a <a href="https://www.mmmx.cloud/what-is-a-memex" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">memex</a>, a wiki, a journal, or a blog. Record your thoughts. If only for your own recollection.</p>
<hr />
<p>This thought was inspired by <a href="https://memory.elliott.computer" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Elliot</a> and <a href="https://www.bernadettemayer.com/memory-1" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Bernadette</a>.</p>]]></description>

            <title>10 Pointless Facts About Me</title>

            <guid isPermaLink="false">blog/10-facts</guid>
            <pubDate>Sat, 07 Nov 2025 00:00:00 +0100</pubDate>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>This topic has been doing the rounds on the indie web recently, initially prompted by <a href="https://forkingmad.blog/ten-pointless-facts-about-me/" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">David</a> and subsequently by <a href="https://manuelmoreale.com/thoughts/10-pointless-facts-about-me" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Manu</a>. But instead of using the original template of questions, as many others have done, I’ve decided to create my own pointless series of questions and answers to give you a random glimpse into my life as I currently know it.</p>
<hr />
<p>[1] What’s the last thing you fixed?</p>
<p>Probably my relationship or some code. When it comes to material things, I tend to replace rather than repair. Mostly out of convenience, but also because I’m terrible at DIY. I do try on occasion though.</p>
<p>[2] Favourite website right now?</p>
<p>The best place on the web is <a href="https://www.are.na/carl-barenbrug/" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">are.na</a> — hands down. But some recent gems I’m enjoying are <a href="https://www.artifacts.is/" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">artifacts.is</a>, <a href="https://www.nts.live" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">nts.live</a>, <a href="https://searchsystem.co/" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">searchsystem.co</a>, and of course <a href="https://theforest.link" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">theforest.link</a>.</p>
<p>[3] How many house plants do you own?</p>
<p>Fourteen plants of varying sizes. One of them, a Howea palm, completely dominates a room, to the point I’m in two minds about trimming it down or selling it to someone with a larger space than me. What to do?</p>
<p>[4] Something you’ve stopped caring about recently?</p>
<p>Being frugal. I still enjoy saving and investing, but I’ve realised life is meant to be lived, not just planned. If there’s something I genuinely want or need, I’ll allow myself the luxury of buying it (within reason), while keeping my minimalist values intact. Self-care above all else.</p>
<p>[5] An item on your wish-list you can’t justify paying for?</p>
<p>Probably most things on my wish list, to be honest. I usually save items for their aesthetic appeal rather than any real need to own them. That said, if I had to pick one (or two), it would be a Suzuki Jimny or a pair of ACRONYM cargos.</p>
<p>[6] What do you want to like more than you actually like?</p>
<p>Probably matcha. I just can’t enjoy it. I also refuse to add a tonne of sugar or honey to improve the flavour. That approach would make anything taste better. I’ll stick to coffee.</p>
<p>[7] Favourite form of exercise?</p>
<p>Rock climbing, mainly bouldering. I also love playing tennis, and lately I’ve been getting into swimming and running. And no, you won’t see me lining up for an Ironman, likely, ever.</p>
<p>[8] Which season do you feel most connected to?</p>
<p>Spring. Usually ideal outdoor climbing conditions, and it’s when the world wakes from its winter slumber. It‘s a new energy.</p>
<p>[9] Something you miss from childhood?</p>
<p>Human connection. Today, I spend more time behind a screen than I do looking into the eyes of others. I also miss the cottage I grew up in.</p>
<p>[10] Something you want to do more often?</p>
<p>Voice messaging. Although I love text-based communication, I want to lean into voice notes more often. I know it can feel less convenient at times, but I think it introduces an endearing quality to how we interact with one another.</p>
<hr />
<p>If you decide to use this template, I’d love to read your answers too. So shoot me an <a href="mailto:&#99;&#x61;&#x72;&#108;&#64;&#109;&#105;&#110;&#x69;&#109;&#x61;&#108;&#x69;&#x73;&#x6d;&#x2e;&#x63;&#x6f;&#x6d;">email</a>.</p>]]></description>

            <title>A Month of Voice Notes</title>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>For the month of November, I shared a small social experiment with a few friends where our messages, which would ordinarily be text-based, were strictly audio. Why? I think I wanted to deepen the human connection I had with people. And I wanted to test how comfortable I could become sending voice notes, and whether it would meaningfully change how I communicate. The rules were simple:</p>
<ul>
<li>no text messages  </li>
<li>images, video, and audio allowed  </li>
<li>web links allowed  </li>
<li>emoji reactions allowed  </li>
</ul>
<p>Quite simple, really. So I was curious how this would go. One of the people I shared this experience with was <a href="https://manuelmoreale.com" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Manu</a>. The result was quite interesting, actually. On balance, we communicated less that month than we would normally, but I think that’s partly down to how we each treat an audio message relative to text. Audio feels more considered, more intentional, and typically more comprehensive.</p>
<p>But as neither of us are used to sending audio on the daily, there was probably an element of self-consciousness too. I know I had to re-record my messages a bunch of times because I either lost my train of thought, or found myself filling gaps with “umms” and “ehs”, which I hate myself for doing. <em>Note to self: embrace the silent gaps to think.</em></p>
<p>Ultimately, I think I still communicate better through text, but that’s not necessarily permanent. It’s simply because I’m not used to sending voice notes. The more I do it, the more natural it’ll feel. The better the flow. The more confidence I’ll have. So the outcome is that from this point on, I’m going to mix things up. With everyone. Some text, some audio. And who knows? Maybe I’ll start sending short video clips too. Oh the humanity.</p>
<p>It makes you think... our modes of communication should be as diverse as our personalities.</p>]]></description>

            <title>Friction by Design</title>
            <link>https://carlbarenbrug.com/@/page/72v14tdhhku2oxpi</link>

            <description><![CDATA[<blockquote>
<p>What gets lost when everything is effortless?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For years, good digital design has been framed as the removal of friction. Faster flows. Fewer steps. Instant feedback. Smooth, seamless interactions that disappear into the background. If something slows a user down, it’s treated as a flaw to be eliminated.</p>
<p>And in many cases, that instinct is right. Unnecessary friction is frustrating. It wastes time. It creates confusion where none should exist.</p>
<p>But not all friction is accidental. And not all friction is bad.</p>
<p>Friction, when designed deliberately, serves a different purpose. It introduces a pause. A moment of awareness. A small resistance that asks the user to pay attention to what they’re doing, rather than simply passing through an interface on autopilot.</p>
<p>Friction exists to make us notice what we’re doing.</p>
<p>The problem with unrelenting frictionless design is that it optimises for motion, not meaning. When everything is instant, actions lose their weight. Decisions blur into habits. Interfaces encourage speed even when judgement, care, or reflection would serve people better.</p>
<p>This is where friction becomes a design choice, not a failure.</p>
<p>I’m not arguing to make things harder. I’m arguing to make them more considered. Because when design removes every obstacle, it doesn’t just remove effort. Sometimes, it removes awareness too.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Good vs bad friction</h2>
<p>Bad friction is friction without purpose. It exists by accident, or through neglect. It asks more from the user without offering anything in return.</p>
<p>Good friction is different. It’s intentional. It’s added with a clear reason, and it earns its place in the experience — often through utility.</p>
<p>Bad friction wastes time. Good friction respects it. </p>
<hr />
<h2>Where friction helps</h2>
<p>Good friction is easiest to understand when you recognise it.</p>

<hr />
<h2>Designing for people, not momentum</h2>
<p>Humans don’t operate best at machine speed. We think, hesitate, reconsider, and change our minds. Design that ignores this doesn’t make people more efficient — it instead pushes them to move faster than their intent.</p>
<p>Design that respects attention also respects limits. It recognises that focus is finite, judgement is contextual, and not every action should happen at the same pace.</p>
<p>Ease without thought isn’t progress. It’s just acceleration.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>A blogger challenge. Thanks, <a href="https://manuelmoreale.com/thoughts/a-random-list-of-silly-things-i-hate">Manu</a>. And being British, there’s simply no chance I can pass up the opportunity to complain about things I dislike. Hate is a strong word, though. My feelings aren’t <em>that</em> strong. When I was thinking about this topic, there’s probably hundreds of mildly annoying things that I’ll find myself complaining about day-to-day. Actually, <a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/kaylaharrington/how-easily-annoyed-are-you-check-off-annoying-habits">Buzzfeed</a> has a pretty good list that any sane person would agree with. And I feel like I’m a fairly tolerable guy. But I’m trying to think of a handful of other things I dislike in this otherwise wonderful life.</p>
<ul>
<li>maximalism</li>
<li>bad kerning</li>
<li>virtue signalling</li>
<li>unjustified entitlement</li>
<li>social media influencers</li>
<li>no free wifi in coffee shops</li>
<li>newsletters without an unsubscribe link</li>
<li>the inevitability of injuries that come with age</li>
<li>how phone batteries still only last about 24 hours</li>
<li>parallax and scroll effects that slow everything down</li>
<li>subscriptions for things that used to be one-time purchases</li>
<li>when people use specific emoji skin colours rather than the default yellow 🖕</li>
<li>greetings and sign-offs in every email of a chain (emails should be written like messages)</li>
<li>further to the above, images in email signatures</li>
</ul>]]></description>
